    "text": "Elemental counfounds\nThere are four elemental confounds [@mcelreath2020 p.185]. Consider how chronological consciensciousness assists with understanding both constraints on data.\n\n1. The problem of confounding by common cause\nThe problem of confounding by common cause arises when there is a variable denoted by L that influences both the exposure, denoted by A and the outcome variable, denoted by Y. Because L is a common cause of A and L is may create a statistical association between A and Y that does not reflect a causal association between A and Y. Put differently, although intervening on A might not affect Y, A and Y may be associated. For example, people who smoke may have yellow fingers. Smoking causes cancer. Because smoking (L) is a common cause of yellow fingers (A) and cancer (Y), A and Y will be associated. However, intervening to change the colour of people’s fingers would not affect cancer. The dashed red arrow in the graph indicate bias arising from the open backdoor path from A to Y that results from the common cause L.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Counfounding by common cause. The dashed red arrow indicates bias arising from the open backdoor path from A to Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice: attend to the temporal order of cauasality\nConfounding by a common cause can be addressed by adjusting for it. Typically we adjust through through statistical models such as regression, matching, or inverse probability of treatment weighting. Again, it is beyond the scope of this tutorial to describe causal estimation techniques. Figure Figure 2 clarifies that any confounding that is a cause of A and Y will precede A (and so Y), because causes precede effects. By indexing the the nodes on the graph, we can see that confounding control typically requires time-series data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Solution: adjust for pre-exposure confounder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Confounding by collider stratification (conditioning on a common effect)\nConditioning on a common effect occurs when a variable L is affected by both the treatment A and an outcome Y.\nSuppose A and Y are initially independent, such that A \\coprod Y(a). Conditioning on the common effect L opens a backdoor path between A and Y, possibly inducing an association. This occurs because L gives information about the relationship of A and Y. Here’s an example:\nLet A denote “exercise”. Let Y denote “heart disease”. Let L denote “weight”. Suppose, “exercise” and “heart disease” are not causally linked. However, they both affect “weight”, and if we condition on “weight” in a cross-sectional study, we might find a statistical association between “exercise” and “heart disease” even in the absence of causation.\nWe denote the observed associations as follows:\n\nP(A = 1): Probability of exercising\nP(Y = 1): Probability of having heart disease\nP(L = 1): Probability of being overweight\n\nWithout conditioning on L, we have:\nP(A = 1, Y = 1) = P(A = 1)P(Y = 1)\nHowever, if we condition on L (thecommon effect of both A and Y), we find:\nP(A = 1, Y = 1 | L = 1) \\neq P(A = 1 | L = 1)P(Y = 1 | L = 1)\nThe common effect L, once conditioned on, creates a non-causal association between A and Y. This can mislead us into believing there’s a direct link between exercise and heart disease, which is not the case. In the cross-sectional data, if we only observe A, Y, and L without understanding their causal relationship, we might erroneously conclude that there is a causal relationship between A and Y. This is the collider stratification bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Confounding by conditioning on a collider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice: attend to the temporal order of cauasality\nTo address the problem of conditioning on a common effect, we should generally ensure that all confounders L that are common causes of the exposure A and the outcome Y are measured before the occurance of the exposure A, and furthermore that the exposure A is measured before the occurance of the outcome Y. If such temporal order is preserved, L cannot be an effect of A, and thus neither of Y. By measuring all relevant confounders before the exposure, researchers can minimise the scope for collider confounding by conditioning on a common effect. This rule is not absolute. As indicated in Figure 9, it may be useful in certain circumstances to condition on a confounder that occurs after the outcome has occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Solution: avoid colliders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM-bias: conditioning on a collider that occurs before the exposure may introduce bias\nTypically, confounders should be measured before their exposures. However, researchers should be cautious about conditioning on pre-exposure variable, as doing so can induce confounding. As shown in Figure 5, collider stratification may arise even if L occurs before A. This happens when L does not affect A or Y, but may be the descendent of a unmeasured variable that affects A and another unmeasured variable that also affects Y. Conditioning on L in this scenario elicits what is called “M-bias.” Note, however, that if L is not a common cause of A and Y, L should not be included in our model because it is not a source of confounding. Here, A \\coprod Y(a) and A \\cancel{\\coprod} Y(a)| L. The solution: do not condition on the pre-exposure variable L.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: M-bias: confounding control by including previous measures of the outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 The problem of conditioning on a mediator\nConditioning on a mediator occurs when L lies on the causal pathway between the treatment A and the outcome Y. Conditioning on L can lead to biased estimates by blocking or distorting the total effect of A and Y. Where L is a mediator, including L will typically attenuate the effect of A on Y. This scenario is presented in Figure 6. Where L is a collider between A and an unmeasured confouder U, then including L may increase the strength of association between A and Y. This scenario is presented in Figure 8.\nIn either case, unless one is interested in mediation analysis, conditioning on a post-treatment variable is nearly always a bad idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Confounding by a mediator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice: attend to the temporal order of cauasality\nTo address the problem of mediator bias, when interested in total effects do not condition on a mediator. This can be done by ensuring that L occurs before A (and Y). Again we discover the importance of an explicit temporal ordering for our variables. Although note, if L is associated with Y but is not associated with A conditioning on L will improve the efficiency of the causal effect estimate of A on Y. However, if A might affect L, then L might be a mediator, and including L risks bias. As with some much in causal estimation, we must understand the context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Ensure confounders occur before exposures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Conditioning on a descendant\nSay X is a cause of X\\prime. If we condition on X we partially condition on X\\prime.\nThere are both negative and positive implications for causal estimation in real-world scenarios.\nFirst the negative. Suppose there is a confounder L that is caused by an unobserved variable U, and is affected by the treatment A. Suppose further that U causes the outcome Y. In this scenario, as described in Figure 8, conditioning on L, which is a descendant of A and U, can lead to a spurious association between A and Y through the path A \\to L \\to U \\to Y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Confounding by descent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice: attend to the temporal order of causality, and use expert knowledge of all relevant nodes.\nEnsuring the confounder (L) is measured before the exposure (A) has two benefits.\nFirst, if L is a confounder, that is, if L is a variable which if we fail to condition on it will bias the association between treatment and outcome, the strategy of including only pre-treatment indicators of L will reduce bias. Figure 9 presents this strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Solution: again, ensure temporal ordering in all measured variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondly, note that we may use descendent to reduce bias. For example, if an unmeasured confounder U affects A, Y, and L\\prime, then adjusting for L\\prime may help to reduce confounding caused by U. This scenario is presented in Figure 10. Note that in this graph, L\\prime may occur after the exposure, and indeed after the outcome. This shows that it would be wrong to infer that merely because causes preceed effects, we should only condition on confounders that preceed the exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Solution: note that conditioning on a confounder that occurs after the exposure and outcome addresses the problem of unmeasured confounding. The dotted paths denote that the effect of U on A and Y is partially adjusted by conditioning on L, even though L occurs after the outcome. The dotted blue path suggest suppressing of the biased relationship between A and Y under the null. A genetic factor that affects the exposure and the outcome early in life, and that also expresses a measured indicator late in life, might constitute an example for which post-outcome confounding control might be possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCausal Interaction?\nApplied researchers will often be interested in testing interactions. What is causal interaction and how may we represent it on a causal diagramme?\nWe must distinguish the concept of causal interaction from the concept of effect modification.\n\nCausal interaction as two independent exposures\nCausal interaction is the effect of two exosures that may occur jointly or separately (or not occur). We say there is interaction on the scale of interest when the effect of one exposure on an outcome depends on the level of another exposure. For example, the effect of a drug (exposure A) on recovery time from a disease (outcome Y) might depend on whether or not the patient is also receiving physical therapy (exposure B). In terms of causal quantities, if we denote the potential outcomes under different exposure combinations as Y(a,b), a causal interaction on the difference scale would be present if Y(1,1) - Y(1,0) \\neq Y(0,1) - Y(0,0).\nWhen drawing a causal diagram, we represent the two exposures as separate nodes and draw edges from them to the outcome, as showin in Figure 11. This is because causal diagrams are non-parametric; they represent the qualitative aspects of causal relationships without making specific assumptions about the functional form of these relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Causal interaction: the are two exposures are causally independent of each other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect measures for causal interaction\nOn the difference scale, the total causal effect of an exposure A on an outcome Y is typically quantified as Y(1) - Y(0), where Y(a) represents the potential outcome under exposure level a. If there is another exposure B, the causal interaction effect on the difference scale would be quantified as [Y(1,1) - Y(1,0)] - [Y(0,1) - Y(0,0)].\nNote that causal effect of interactions might differ on the ratio scale. For instance, the total causal effect on the ratio scale would be Y(1) / Y(0), and the interaction effect would be [Y(1,1) / Y(1,0)] / [Y(0,1) / Y(0,0)].\n\n\nCausal interaction as effect modification\nEffect modification models the effect the magnitude of of a single exposure on an outcome across different levels of another variable.\nHere we assume independence of the counterfactual outcome conditional on measured confounders, within strata of co-variate G:\nY(a) \\coprod A | L, G\nNote that there here, there is only one counterfactual outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: A simple graph for effect-modification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice for causal mediation\n\nNo unmeasured exposure-outcome confounders given L\nThis assumption is denoted by Y(a,m) \\coprod A | L. It implies that when we control for the covariates L, there are no unmeasured confounders that influence both the exposure A and the outcome Y. For example, if we are studying the effect of a drug (exposure) on recovery time from a disease (outcome), and age and gender are our covariates L, this assumption would mean that there are no other factors, not accounted for in L, that influence both the decision to take the drug and the recovery time.\nNo unmeasured mediator-outcome confounders given L\nThis assumption is denoted by Y(a,m) \\coprod M | L. It implies that when we control for the covariates L, there are no unmeasured confounders that influence both the mediator M and the outcome Y. For instance, if we are studying the effect of exercise (exposure) on weight loss (outcome) mediated by calorie intake (mediator), and age and gender are our covariates L, this assumption would mean that there are no other factors, not accounted for in L, that influence both the calorie intake and the weight loss.\nNo unmeasured exposure-mediator confounders given L\nThis assumption is denoted by M(a) \\coprod A | L. It implies that when we control for the covariates L, there are no unmeasured confounders that influence both the exposure A and the mediator M. Using the previous example, this assumption would mean that there are no other factors, not accounted for in L, that influence both the decision to exercise and the calorie intake.\nNo mediator-outcome confounder affected by the exposure (no red arrow)\n\nThis assumption is denoted by Y(a,m) \\coprod M^{a*} | L. It implies that there are no variables that confound the relationship between the mediator and the outcome that are affected by the exposure. For example, if we are studying the effect of education (exposure) on income (outcome) mediated by job type (mediator), this assumption would mean that there are no factors that influence both job type and income that are affected by the level of education.\nThese assumptions are fundamental for the identification of causal mediation effects. If these assumptions are violated, the estimates of the mediation effect can be biased. Importantly, these assumptions cannot be fully tested with observed data. They require substantive knowledge about the underlying causal process. Note that when assumption 4 is violated, natural direct and indirect effects are not identified in the data. [Cite Tyler here]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Assumptions for mediation analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice for modelling repeated exposures in longitudinal data (confounder-treatment feedback)?\nCausal mediation is a special case in which we have multiple sequential exposures.\nFor example, consider temporally fixed multiple exposures. The counterfactual outcomes may be denoted Y(a_{t1} ,a_{t2}). There are four counterfactual outcomes corresponding to the four fixed “treatment regimes”:\n\nAlways treat (Y(1,1)): This regime involves providing the treatment at every opportunity.\nNever treat (Y(0,0)): This regime involves abstaining from providing the treatment at any opportunity.\nTreat once first (Y(1,0)): This regime involves providing the treatment only at the first opportunity and not at subsequent one.\nTreat once second (Y(0,1)): This regime involves abstaining from providing the treatment at the first opportunity, but then providing it at the second one.\n\nThere are six causal contrasts that we might compute.1\n\nAlways treat vs. Never treat\nAlways treat vs. Treat once first\nAlways treat vs. Treat once second\nNever treat vs. Treat once first\nNever treat vs. Treat once second\nTreat once first vs. Treat once second\n\nWe might also consider treatment to be a function of the previous outcome. For example, we might Treat once first and then treat again or do not treat again depending on the outcome of the previous treatment. This is called “time-varying treatment regimes.”\nNote that to estimate the “effect” of a treatment regime, we must compare the counterfactual quantities of interest. The same conditions that apply for causal identification in mediation analysis apply to causal idenification in multiple treatment settings. And notice, just as mediation opens the possibility of time-varying confounding (condition 4, in which the exposure effects the confounders of the mediator/outcome path), so too we find that with time-varying treatments comes the problem of time-varying confounding. Unlike traditional causal mediation analysis, the sequence of treatement regimes that we might consider is indefinitely long.\nTemporally organised causal diagrammes help us to discover the problems with traditional multi-level regression analysis and structural equation modelling. Suppose we are interested in the question of whether beliefs in big Gods affect social complexity.\nFirst consider fixed regimes Suppose we have well-defined concept of social complexity and excellent measurements over time. Suppose we want to compare the effects of beliefs on big Gods on Social complexity using historical data measured over two centuries. Our question is whether the introduction and persistence of such beliefs differs from having no such beliefs. The treatment strategies are: “always believe in big Gods” versus “never believe in big Gods” on the level of social complexity. The a causal diagram illustrates two time points in our study the study.\nHere, A_{tx} represents the cultural belief in “big Gods” at time x, and Y_{tx} is the outcome, social complexity, at time x. Economic trade, denoted as L_{tx}, is a time-varying confounder because it varies over time and confounds the effect of A on Y at several time points x. To complete our causal diagramme we include an unmeasured confounder U, such as geographical constraints, which might influence both the belief in “big Gods” and social complexity.\nWe know that the level of economic trade at time 0, L_{t0}, influences the belief in “big Gods” at time 1, A_{t1}. We therefore draw an arrow from L_{t0} to A_{t1}. But we also know that the belief in “big Gods”, A_{t1}, affects the future level of economic trade, L_{t(2)}. This means that we need to add an arrow from A_{t1} to L_{t(2)}. This causal graph represents a feedback process between the time-varying exposure A and the time-varying confounder L. This is the simplest graph with exposure-confounder feedback. In real world setting there could be arrows. However, our DAG however need show the minimum number of arrows to exhibit the problem of exposure-confounder feedback.\nWhat happens if we condition on the time-varying confounder L_{t3}. Two things occur. First, we block all the backdoor paths between the exposure A_{t2} and the outcome. We need to block those paths to eliminate confounding. Therefore, condition on the time-varying confounding would appear to be essential. Second, paths that were previously blocked are now open. For example, the path A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{t(4)}, which was previous closed is opened because the time varying confounder is the common effect of A_{t1} and U. Conditioning opens the path A_{t1}, L_{t2}, U, Y_{3}. The same problem occurs if the time-varying exposure and time-varying confounder share a common cause (without the exposure affecting the confounder). And the problem is only more entrenched when the exposures A_{t1} affects the outcome Y_{t4}. Because L_{t2} is along the path from A_{t1} to Y_{t4} conditioning on L_{t2} partially blocks the path between the exposure and the outcome. Conditioning on L_{t2} in this setting induces both collider stratification bias and mediator bias. Yet we must conditoin on L_{t2} to block the open backdoor path between L_{t2} and Y_{t4}. The general problem of xposure-confounder feedback is described in detail in [@hernan2023]. This problem presents a serious issue for cultural evolutionary studies. The bad news is that nearly traditional regresion based methods cannot address this problem. The good new is that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Exposure confounder feedback is a problem for time-series models. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be addressed with regression-based methods, whatever the combination of Bayesian, multi-level, and phylogentic sophistication. We may only estimate controlled (simulated) effects in these setting using G-methods. Currently, outside of epidemiology, g-methods are rarely used.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about SWIGS…"

We need to clarify:\n\nThe amount, regularity, and duration of exercise\nThe measures of depression to be used\nThe expected timeline for observing the effects\n\nRemember, we can clarify these by emulating a hypothetical experiment, a concept we call the Target Trial.\nOur initial responses will be guided by the NZAVS measure of exercise, focusing on the hours of activity per week, the 1-year effect on Kessler-6 depression after initiating a change in exercise, and a particular emphasis on effect-modification by NZ European and Māori ethnic identification.\nThis analysis has practical motivation, as the effects of exercise on mental health and possible differences between cultural groups remain largely uncharted territory.\nOur initial responses will be guided by the NZAVS measure of exercise, focusing on the hours of activity per week, the 1-year effect on Kessler-6 depression after initiating a change in exercise, and a particular emphasis on effect-modification by NZ European and Māori ethnic identification. This analysis has practical motivation, as the effects of exercise on mental health and possible differences between cultural groups remain largely uncharted territory.\n\nSculpting the Data: A Hands-On Approach\nAs we venture further, we’ll perform a series of transformations to shape our data according to our needs. Our process will involve:\n\nConstructing a Kessler 6 average score\nBuilding a Kessler 6 sum score\nCoarsening the Exercise score\n\nConsider the ambiguity in the NZAVS exercise question: “During the past week, list ‘Hours spent exercising/physical activity’.” Different people interpret physical activity differently; John may consider any wakeful time as physical activity, while Jane counts only aerobic exercise. Such variation underlines the importance of the consistency assumption in causal inference.

Recall the consistency assumption of causal inference:\nConsistency: Can I interpret what it means to intervene on the exposure? I should be able to.\nWhat is th hypothetical experiment here for change in exercise?\nThrough data wrangling, we can answer our research questions more effectively by manipulating variables into more meaningful and digestible forms.

This suggest that we are ready to proceed with the next step of causal estimation.\n\nCreate wide data frame for analysis\nRecall, I wrote a function for you that will put the data into temporal order such that measurement of the exposure and outcome appear at baseline, along with a rich set of baseline confounders, the exposure appears in the following wave, and the outcome appears in the wave following the exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Causal graph: three-wave panel design\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph encodes our assumptions about the world. It is a qualitative instrument to help us understand how to move from our assumptions to decisions about our analysis, in the first instance, the decision about whether to proceed with an analysis.\nIt is perhaps useful here to stop and consider what does this graph implies.\nQuestion: 1. Does the graph imply unmeasured confounding?\nQuestion 2. If there is unmeasured confounding, should we proceed?\n\n\nE-value\n\nThe minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, conditional on the measured covariates, to fully explain away a specific exposure-outcome association\n\nSee: [VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen (2020)](Mathur et al. 2018)\nFor example, suppose that the lower bound of the the E-value was 1.3 with the lower bound of the confidence interval = 1.12, we might then write:\n\nWith an observed risk ratio of RR=1.3, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 1.3-fold each (or 30%), above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the estimate, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to move the confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 1.12-fold (or 12%) each could do so, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.\n\nThe equations are as follows (for risk ratios)\n\nE-value_{RR} = RR + \\sqrt{RR \\times (RR - 1)}\n \nE-value_{LCL} = LCL + \\sqrt{LCL \\times (LCL - 1)}\n\nHere is an R function that will calculate E-values\n\ncalculate_e_value &lt;- function(rr, lcl) {\n  e_value_rr = rr + sqrt(rr*(rr - 1))\n  e_value_lcl = lcl + sqrt(lcl*(lcl - 1))\n  \n  list(e_value_rr = e_value_rr, e_value_lcl = e_value_lcl)\n}\n\n# e.g. smoking causes cancer\n\n# finding   RR = 10.73 (95% CI: 8.02, 14.36)\n\ncalculate_e_value(10.73, 8.02)\n\n$e_value_rr\n[1] 20.94777\n\n$e_value_lcl\n[1] 15.52336\n\n\nWe write:\n\nWith an observed risk ratio of RR=10.7, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 20.9-fold each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the estimate, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to move the confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 15.5-fold each could do so, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.\n\nNote that in this class, most of the outcomes will be (standardised) continuous outcomes. Here’s a function and LaTeX code to describe the approximation.\nThis function takes a linear regression coefficient estimate (est), its standard error (se), the standard deviation of the outcome (sd), a contrast of interest in the exposure (delta, which defaults to 1), and a “true” standardized mean difference (true, which defaults to 0). It calculates the odds ratio using the formula from Chinn (2000) and VanderWeele (2017), and then uses this to calculate the E-value.\n\n#| label: evalue_ols\n\ncompute_evalue_ols &lt;- function(est, se, delta = 1, true = 0) {\n  # Rescale estimate and SE to reflect a contrast of size delta\n  est &lt;- est / delta\n  se &lt;- se / delta\n\n  # Compute transformed odds ratio and confidence intervals\n  odds_ratio &lt;- exp(0.91 * est)\n  lo &lt;- exp(0.91 * est - 1.78 * se)\n  hi &lt;- exp(0.91 * est + 1.78 * se)\n\n  # Compute E-Values based on the RR values\n  evalue_point_estimate &lt;- odds_ratio * sqrt(odds_ratio + 1)\n  evalue_lower_ci &lt;- lo * sqrt(lo + 1)\n\n  # Return the E-values\n  return(list(EValue_PointEstimate = evalue_point_estimate,\n              EValue_LowerCI = evalue_lower_ci))\n}\n\n\n\n\n# exampl:\n# suppose we have an estimate of 0.5, a standard error of 0.1, and a standard deviation of 1.\n# This would correspond to a half a standard deviation increase in the outcome per unit increase in the exposure.\nresults &lt;- compute_evalue_ols(est = 0.5, se = 0.1, delta = 1)\nprint(results)\n\n$EValue_PointEstimate\n[1] 2.529831\n\n$EValue_LowerCI\n[1] 2.008933\n\n\nWe write:\n\nWith an observed risk ratio of RR=2.92, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 2.92-fold each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the estimate, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to move the confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 2.23-fold each could do so, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.\n\nNote the E-values package will do the computational work for us (note we get slightly different estimates)\nNote:\nFirst, the fucntion converts the estimate to an odds ratio:\n\nOdds Ratio Conversion:\n(OddsRatio = e^{ })\n\nThen, it calculates the confidence intervals for the odds ratio:\n\nConfidence Intervals:\n(LowerConfidenceInterval = e^{log(OddsRatio) - 1.78 SE})\n(UpperConfidenceInterval = e^{log(OddsRatio) + 1.78 SE})\n\nFinally, it calculates the E-value for the point estimate and the lower confidence interval:\n\nE-Values Calculation:\n(EValue_{PointEstimate} = OddsRatio + )\n(EValue_{LowerCI} = LowerConfidenceInterval + )\n\n[[JB: NEED TO CHECK]]\nGenerally, best to use the EValue function.\n\nlibrary(EValue)\n\nEValue::evalues.OLS(est = 0.5, se = 0.1, sd = 1, delta = 1, true = 0)\n\n            point    lower    upper\nRR       1.576173 1.319166 1.883252\nE-values 2.529142 1.968037       NA\n\n\n\n############## ############## ############## ############## ############## ############## ############## ########\n####  ####  ####  CREATE DATA FRAME FOR ANALYSIS ####  ####  ################## ############## ######## #########\n############## ############## ############## ############## ############## ############## ############# #########\n\n\n# I have created a function that will put the data into the correct shape.

Data wrangling is the majority of data analysis. The good news is that R makes wrangling relatively straightforward.\n\nmutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))): This creates a new column called id that has unique identification factors for each row in the dataset. It ranges from 1 to the number of rows in the dataset.\nThe next mutate operation is used to convert the t0_eth_cat, t0_urban, and t0_gen_cohort variables to factor type, if they are not already.\nThe filter command is used to subset the dataset to only include rows where the t0_eth_cat is either “euro” or “māori”. The original dataset includes data with four different ethnic categories. This command filters out any row not related to these two groups.\nungroup() ensures that there’s no grouping in the dataframe.\nThe mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) step standardizes all numeric columns in the dataset by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (a z-score transformation). The resulting columns are renamed to include “_z” at the end of their original names.\nThe select function is used to keep only specific columns: the id column, any columns that are factors, and any columns that end in “_z”.\nThe relocate functions re-order columns. The first relocate places the id column at the beginning. The next three relocate functions order the rest of the columns based on their names: those starting with “t0_” are placed before “t1_” columns, and those starting with “t2_” are placed after “t1_” columns.\ndroplevels() removes unused factor levels in the dataframe.\nFinally, skimr::skim(dt) will print out a summary of the data in the dt object using the skimr package. This provides a useful overview of the data, including data types and summary statistics.\n\nThis function seems to be part of a data preparation pipeline in a longitudinal or panel analysis, where observations are ordered over time (indicated by t0_, t1_, t2_, etc.).\n\n### ### ### ### ### ### SUBGROUP DATA ANALYSIS: DATA WRANGLING  ### ### ### ###\n\ndt &lt;- dt_prepare|&gt;\n  mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n  t0_eth_cat = as.factor(t0_eth_cat),\n  t0_urban = as.factor(t0_urban),\n  t0_gen_cohort = as.factor(t0_gen_cohort)\n) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(t0_eth_cat == \"euro\" |\n                t0_eth_cat == \"māori\") |&gt;

Instead of modelling the outcome (t2_y) we will model the exposure (t1_x) as predicted by baseline indicators (t0_c) that we assume may be associated with the outcome and the exposure.\nThe first step is to obtain the baseline variables. note that we must remove “t0_eth_cat” because we are performing separate weighting for each stratum within this variable.\n\n# read  data -- you may start here if you need to repeat the analysis\ndt &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n# get column names\nbaseline_vars_reflective_propensity &lt;- dt|&gt;\n  dplyr::select(starts_with(\"t0\"), -t0_eth_cat) |&gt; colnames()\n\n# define our exposure\nX &lt;- \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen\"\n\n# define subclasses\nS &lt;- \"t0_eth_cat\"\n\n# Make sure data is in a data frame format\ndt &lt;- data.frame(dt)\n\n\n# next we use our trick for creating a formula string, which will reduce our work\nformula_str_prop &lt;-\n  paste(X,\n        \"~\",\n        paste(baseline_vars_reflective_propensity, collapse = \"+\"))\n\n# this shows the exposure variable as predicted by the baseline confounders.\n\nFor propensity score analysis, we will try several different approaches. We will want to select the method that produces the best balance.\nI typically use ps (classical propensity scores), ebal and energy. The latter two in my experience yeild good balance. Also energy will work with continuous exposures.\nFor more information, see https://ngreifer.github.io/WeightIt/\n\n# traditional propensity scores-- note we select the ATT and we have a subgroup \ndt_match_ps &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  method = \"ps\"\n)\n\nsaveRDS(dt_match_ps, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ps\"))\n\n\n# ebalance\ndt_match_ebal &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  method = \"ebal\"\n)\n\n# save output\nsaveRDS(dt_match_ebal, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ebal\"))\n\n\n\n## energy balance method\ndt_match_energy &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  #focal = \"high\", # for use with ATT\n  method = \"energy\"\n)\nsaveRDS(dt_match_energy, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy\"))\n\nResults, first for Europeans\n\n#dt_match_energy &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy\"))\ndt_match_ebal &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ebal\"))\n#dt_match_ps &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ps\"))\n\n# next we inspect balance. \"Max.Diff.Adj\" should ideally be less than .05, but less than .1 is ok.

Of these approaches, entropy balancing provided the best balance. The results indicate an excellent balance across all variables, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold of 0.05 across a range of binary and continuous baseline confounders, including gender, generation cohort, urban_location, exercise hours (coarsened, baseline), education, employment status, depression, anxiety, and various personality traits. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs.\nThe effective sample sizes were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 2880, 3927, and 1834, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 1855.89, 3659.59, and 1052.01, respectively.\nThe weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2310 to 7.0511) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.5769 to 1.9603). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\nWe also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\nWe plotted these results using love plots, visually confirming both the balance in the propensity score model using entropy balanced weights, and the imbalance in the model that does not adjust for baseline confounders.\nOverall, these findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, conditional on the measured covariates included in the model.\n\n\nExample Summary Maori Propensity scores.\nResults:\nThe entropy balancing method was also the best performing method that was applied to a subgroup analysis of the Māori population. Similar to the NZ European subgroup analysis, the method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup.\nThe effective sample sizes for the Māori subgroup were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 307, 354, and 160, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 220.54, 321.09, and 76.39, respectively\nThe weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups in the Māori subgroup varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2213 to 3.8101) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.3995 to 1.9800). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\nThe study also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group for the Māori subgroup. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\nIn conclusion, the results of the Māori subgroup analysis are consistent with the overall analysis. The entropy balancing method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold. These findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, even in subgroup analyses.\n\n\nMore data wrangling\nNote that we need to attach the weights from the propensity score model back to the data.\nHowever, because our weighting analysis estimates a model for the exposure, we only need to do this analysis once, no matter how many outcomes we investigate. So there’s a little good news.\n\n# prepare nz_euro data\ndt_ref_e &lt;- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"euro\") # original data subset only nz europeans\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_e$weights &lt;- dt_match_ebal$euro$weights # get weights from the ps matching model,add to data\n\n# prepare maori data\ndt_ref_m &lt;- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"māori\")# original data subset only maori\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_m$weights &lt;- dt_match_ebal$māori$weights # get weights from the ps matching model, add to data\n\n# combine data into one data frame\ndt_ref_all &lt;- rbind(dt_ref_e, dt_ref_m) # combine the data into one dataframe."

The associated confidence interval, ranging from -0.131 to -0.022, does not cross zero, providing more certainty in our estimate.\n\n\nE-values quantify the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounding variable would need to have with both the treatment and outcome, to fully explain away our observed effect. In this case, any unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both exercise and anxiety reduction, with a risk ratio of at least 1.352 to explain away the observed effect, and at least 1.167 to shift the confidence interval to include a null effect.\n\n\nTurning to the Māori group, the data suggest a possible reducing effect of exercise on anxiety, with a causal contrast value of 0.027. Yet, the confidence interval for this estimate (-0.114 to 0.188) also crosses zero, indicating similar uncertainties. An unmeasured confounder would need to have a risk ratio of at least 1.183 with both exercise and anxiety to account for our observed effect, and a risk ratio of at least 1 to render the confidence interval inclusive of a null effect.\n\n\nThus, while our analysis suggests that exercise could potentially reduce anxiety in both New Zealand Europeans and Māori, we advise caution in interpretation. The confidence intervals crossing zero reflect substantial uncertainties, and the possible impact of unmeasured confounding factors further complicates the picture.\n\nHere’s a function that will do much of this work for you.

This is suggested by the estimated risk difference (RD_m - RD_e) of 0.068. However, there is a degree of uncertainty in this estimate, as the confidence interval (-0.09 to 0.229) crosses zero. This suggests that we cannot be confident that the difference in depression reduction between New Zealand Europeans and Māori is statistically significant. It’s possible that the true difference could be zero or even negative, implying a greater depression reduction for Māori than New Zealand Europeans. Thus, while the results hint at a larger depression reduction for New Zealand Europeans, the uncertainty in this estimate urges us to interpret this difference with caution.\n\n\n\nDiscusion\nYou’ll need to do this yourself. Here’s a start:\n\nIn our study, we employed a robust statistical method that helps us estimate the impact of exercise on reducing anxiety among different population groups – New Zealand Europeans and Māori. This method has the advantage of providing reliable results even if our underlying assumptions aren’t entirely accurate – a likely scenario given the complexity of real-world data. However, this robustness comes with a trade-off: it gives us wider ranges of uncertainty in our estimates. This doesn’t mean the analysis is flawed; rather, it accurately represents our level of certainty given the data we have.\n\n\nExercise and Anxiety\n\nOur analysis suggests that exercise may have a greater effect in reducing anxiety among New Zealand Europeans compared to Māori. This conclusion comes from our primary causal estimate, the risk difference, which is 0.104. However, it’s crucial to consider our uncertainty in this value. We represent this uncertainty as a range, also known as a confidence interval. In this case, the interval ranges from -0.042 to 0.279. What this means is, given our current data and method, the true effect could plausibly be anywhere within this range. While our best estimate shows a higher reduction in anxiety for New Zealand Europeans, the range of plausible values includes zero and even negative values. This implies that the true effect could be no difference between the two groups or even a higher reduction in Māori. Hence, while there’s an indication of a difference, we should interpret it cautiously given the wide range of uncertainty.\n\n\nThus, although our analysis points towards a potential difference in how exercise reduces anxiety among these groups, the level of uncertainty means we should be careful about drawing firm conclusions. More research is needed to further explore these patterns.\n\n\n\nExercise and Depression\n\nIn addition to anxiety, we also examined the effect of exercise on depression. We do not find evidence for reduction of depression from exercise in either group. We do not find evidence for the effect of weekly exercise – as self-reported – on depression.\n\n\n\nProviso\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that statistical results are only one piece of a larger scientific puzzle about the relationship between excercise and well-being. Other pieces include understanding the context, incorporating subject matter knowledge, and considering the implications of the findings. In the present study, wide confidence intervals suggest the possibility of considerable individual differences.\\dots nevertheless, \\dots"

The K6 scale is used to measure psychological distress.\nThe analysis identifies three latent factors, labeled MR1, MR2, and MR3, which collectively account for 66.05% of the variance in the K6 data. The factors MR1, MR2, and MR3 explain 35.14%, 17.17%, and 13.73% of the variance respectively.\nFactor loadings, indicating the strength and direction of the relationship between the K6 items and the latent factors, are as follows:\n\nFactor MR1 is strongly associated with ‘kessler_depressed’, ‘kessler_worthless’, and ‘kessler_hopeless’ with loadings of 0.85, 0.79, and 0.75 respectively.\nFactor MR2 is exclusively linked with ‘kessler_nervous’ with a loading of 1.00.\nFactor MR3 relates to ‘kessler_restless’ and ‘kessler_effort’ with loadings of 0.69 and 0.48 respectively.\n\nThe ‘Uniqueness’ values show the proportion of each variable’s variance that isn’t shared with the other variables.\nThe ‘Complexity’ values give a measure of how each item loads on more than one factor. All the items are either loading exclusively on one factor (complexity=1.00) or slightly more than one factor. ‘kessler_effort’ with complexity of 1.66 shows it’s the item most shared between the factors.\nThe analysis suggests these K6 items measure may measure three somewhat distinct, yet related, factors of psychological distress.\nHowever, the meaning of these factors would need to be interpreted in the context of the variables and the theoretical framework of the study.\nNotably, there are many many theoretical frameworks for in measurement theory.

Other goodness-of-fit indices like GFI, AGFI, NFI, NNFI, and CFI are all high (above 0.9), generally indicating good fit, but these indices can be misleading in the presence of large sample sizes. RMSEA is above 0.1 which indicates a poor fit. The SRMR is less than 0.08 which suggests a good fit, but given the high Chi-square and RMSEA values, we can’t solely rely on this index. The Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and adjusted BIC are used for comparing models, with lower values indicating better fit.\n\n\nTwo_latents CFA\nThis model assumes that there are two underlying latent factors. The chi-square statistic is lower than the one-factor model (317.97 with 13 df), suggesting a better fit. The p-value is still less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significant chi-square, which typically suggests a poor fit. However, all other fit indices (GFI, AGFI, NFI, NNFI, and CFI) are above 0.9 and the RMSEA is 0.051, which generally indicate good fit. The SRMR is also less than 0.08 which suggests a good fit. This model has the lowest AIC and BIC values among the three models, indicating the best fit according to these criteria.\n\n\nThree_latents CFA\nThis model assumes three underlying latent factors. The chi-square statistic is 747.87 with 12 df, higher than the two-factor model, suggesting a worse fit to the data. Other fit indices such as GFI, AGFI, NFI, NNFI, and CFI are below 0.97 and the RMSEA is 0.083, which generally indicate acceptable but not excellent fit. The SRMR is less than 0.08 which suggests a good fit. The AIC and BIC values are higher than the two-factor model but lower than the one-factor model, indicating a fit that is better than the one-factor model but worse than the two-factor model.\nBased on these results, the two-latents model seems to provide the best fit to the data among the three models, according to most of the fit indices and the AIC and BIC. Note, all models have significant chi-square statistics, which suggests some degree of misfit. It’s also important to consider the substantive interpretation of the factors, to make sure the model makes sense theoretically.\n\n\n\nMulti-group Confirmatory Factor Analysis\nThis script runs multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA)\n\n# select needed columns plus 'ethnicity'\n# filter dataset for only 'euro' and 'maori' ethnic categories\ndt_eth_k6_eth &lt;- dt_start |&gt; \n  filter(eth_cat == \"euro\" | eth_cat == \"maori\") |&gt; \n  select(kessler_depressed, kessler_effort,kessler_hopeless,\n         kessler_worthless, kessler_nervous,\n         kessler_restless, eth_cat)\n\n# partition the dataset into training and test subsets\n# stratify by ethnic category to ensure balanced representation\npart_data_eth &lt;- datawizard::data_partition(dt_eth_k6_eth, traing_proportion = .7, seed = 123, group = \"eth_cat\")\n\ntraining_eth &lt;- part_data_eth$p_0.7\ntest_eth &lt;- part_data_eth$test\n\n# run confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models for configural invariance across ethnic groups\n# models specify one, two, and three latent variables\none_latent_eth_configural &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_one, group = \"eth_cat\", data = test_eth))\ntwo_latents_eth_configural &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_two, group = \"eth_cat\", data = test_eth))\nthree_latents_eth_configural &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_three, group = \"eth_cat\", data = test_eth))\n\n# compare model performances for configural invariance\ncompare_eth_configural &lt;- performance::compare_performance(one_latent_eth_configural, two_latents_eth_configural, three_latents_eth_configural, verbose = FALSE)\n\n# run CFA models for metric invariance, holding factor loadings equal across groups\n# models specify one, two, and three latent variables\none_latent_eth_metric &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_one, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal = \"loadings\", data = test_eth))\ntwo_latents_eth_metric  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_two, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal = \"loadings\", data = test_eth))\nthree_latents_eth_metric  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_three, group = \"eth_cat\",group.equal = \"loadings\", data = test_eth))\n\n# compare model performances for metric invariance\ncompare_eth_metric  &lt;- performance::compare_performance(one_latent_eth_metric, two_latents_eth_metric, three_latents_eth_metric, verbose = FALSE)\n\n# run CFA models for scalar invariance, holding factor loadings and intercepts equal across groups\n# models specify one, two, and three latent variables\none_latent_eth_scalar &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_one, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal = c(\"loadings\",\"intercepts\"), data = test_eth))\ntwo_latents_eth_scalar  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_two, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal =  c(\"loadings\",\"intercepts\"), data = test_eth))\nthree_latents_eth_scalar  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_three, group = \"eth_cat\",group.equal =  c(\"loadings\",\"intercepts\"), data = test_eth))\n\n# compare model performances for scalar invariance\ncompare_eth_scalar  &lt;- performance::compare_performance(one_latent_eth_scalar, two_latents_eth_scalar, three_latents_eth_scalar, verbose = FALSE)\n\nRecall, in the context of measurement and factor analysis, the concepts of configural, metric, and scalar invariance relate to the comparability of a measurement instrument, such as a survey or test, across different groups.\nWe saw in part 1 of this course that these invariance concepts are frequently tested in the context of cross-cultural, multi-group, or longitudinal studies.\nLet’s first define these concepts, and then apply them to the context of the Kessler 6 (K6) Distress Scale used among Maori and New Zealand Europeans.\n\nConfigural invariance refers to the most basic level of measurement invariance, and it is established when the same pattern of factor loadings and structure is observed across groups. This means that the underlying or “latent” constructs (factors) are defined the same way for different groups. This doesn’t mean the strength of relationship between items and factors (loadings) or the item means (intercepts) are the same, just that the items relate to the same factors in all groups.\n\nIn the context of the K6 Distress Scale, configural invariance would suggest that the same six items are measuring the construct of psychological distress in the same way for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans, even though the strength of the relationship between the items and the construct (distress), or the average scores, might differ.\n\nMetric invariance (also known as “weak invariance”) refers to the assumption that factor loadings are equivalent across groups, meaning that the relationship or association between the measured items and their underlying factor is the same in all groups. This is important when comparing the strength of relationships with other variables across groups.\n\nIf metric invariance holds for the K6 Distress Scale, this would mean that a unit change in the latent distress factor would correspond to the same change in each item score (e.g., feeling nervous, hopeless, restless, etc.) for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans.\n\nScalar invariance (also known as “strong invariance”) involves equivalence of both factor loadings and intercepts (item means) across groups. This means that not only are the relationships between the items and the factors the same across groups (as with metric invariance), but also the zero-points or origins of the scales are the same. Scalar invariance is necessary when one wants to compare latent mean scores across groups.\n\nIn the context of the K6 Distress Scale, if scalar invariance holds, it would mean that a specific score on the scale would correspond to the same level of the underlying distress factor for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans. It would mean that the groups do not differ systematically in how they interpret and respond to the items. If this holds, one can make meaningful comparisons of distress level between Maori and New Zealand Europeans based on the scale scores.\nNote: each of these levels of invariance is a progressively stricter test of the equivalence of the measurement instrument across groups. Demonstrating scalar invariance, for example, also demonstrates configural and metric invariance. On the other hand, failure to demonstrate metric invariance means that scalar invariance also does not hold. These tests are therefore usually conducted in sequence. The results of these tests should be considered when comparing group means or examining the relationship between a scale and other variables across groups.\n\n\nConfigural invariance\n\nas.data.frame(compare_eth_configural)|&gt;\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nModel\nChi2\nChi2_df\np_Chi2\nBaseline\nBaseline_df\np_Baseline\nGFI\nAGFI\nNFI\nNNFI\nCFI\nRMSEA\nRMSEA_CI_low\nRMSEA_CI_high\np_RMSEA\nRMR\nSRMR\nRFI\nPNFI\nIFI\nRNI\nLoglikelihood\nAIC\nAIC_wt\nBIC\nBIC_wt\nBIC_adjusted\n\n\n\n\none_latent_eth_configural\nlavaan\n1162.4746\n14\n0\n341229.17\n21\n0\n0.9831752\n0.9579381\n0.9965933\n0.9949511\n0.9966341\n0.1027048\n0.0977499\n0.1077479\n0.0000000\n38.29915\n0.0439380\n0.9948899\n0.6643955\n0.9966342\n0.9966341\n-129452.1\n258946.1\n0\n259092.3\n0\n259025.5\n\n\ntwo_latents_eth_configural\nlavaan\n276.7703\n13\n0\n42034.04\n21\n0\n0.9961916\n0.9897467\n0.9934156\n0.9898581\n0.9937217\n0.0510782\n0.0459383\n0.0564019\n0.3560216\n34.17489\n0.0201464\n0.9893636\n0.6149715\n0.9937229\n0.9937217\n-129009.2\n258062.4\n1\n258215.5\n1\n258145.6\n\n\nthree_latents_eth_configural\nlavaan\n701.6287\n12\n0\n27397.50\n21\n0\n0.9906044\n0.9725962\n0.9743908\n0.9559166\n0.9748095\n0.0859629\n0.0806184\n0.0914299\n0.0000000\n76.26852\n0.0358868\n0.9551839\n0.5567947\n0.9748177\n0.9748095\n-129221.6\n258489.3\n0\n258649.3\n0\n258576.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table represents the comparison of three multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models conducted to test for configural invariance across different ethnic categories (eth_cat). Configural invariance refers to whether the pattern of factor loadings is the same across groups. It’s the most basic form of measurement invariance.\nLooking at the results, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\nChi2 (Chi-square): A lower value suggests a better model fit. In this case, the two_latents_eth_configural model exhibits the lowest Chi2 value, suggesting it has the best fit according to this metric.\nGFI (Goodness of Fit Index) and AGFI (Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index): These values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 suggesting a better fit. The two_latents_eth_configural model has the highest GFI and AGFI values, indicating it is the best fit according to these indices.\nNFI (Normed Fit Index), NNFI (Non-Normed Fit Index, also called TLI), CFI (Comparative Fit Index): These range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 suggesting a better fit. The one_latent_eth_configural model has the highest values, suggesting it is the best fit according to these metrics.\nRMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation): Lower values are better, with values below 0.05 considered good and up to 0.08 considered acceptable. In this table, the two_latents_eth_configural model has an RMSEA of 0.05, which falls within the acceptable range.\nRMR (Root Mean Square Residual) and SRMR (Standardized Root Mean Square Residual): Lower values are better, typically less than 0.08 is considered a good fit. All models exhibit acceptable RMR and SRMR values, with the two_latents_eth_configural model having the lowest.\nRFI (Relative Fit Index), PNFI (Parsimonious Normed Fit Index), IFI (Incremental Fit Index), RNI (Relative Noncentrality Index): These range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 suggesting a better fit. The one_latent_eth_configural model has the highest values, suggesting the best fit according to these measures.\nAIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion): Lower values indicate a better fit when comparing models. The two_latents_eth_configural model has the lowest AIC and BIC, suggesting it is the best fit according to these criteria.\np_Chi2 and p_RMSEA: These are the significance levels for the Chi-square test and the RMSEA, respectively. Non-significant values (p &gt; 0.05) suggest a good fit. Only the RMSEA for the two_latents_eth_configural model is non-significant, suggesting a good fit.\n\nOverall, the two_latents_eth_configural model appears to provide the best fit across multiple indices, suggesting configural invariance (i.e., the same general factor structure) across ethnic categories with a two-factor solution. As with the previous assessment, theoretical soundness and other substantive considerations should also be taken into account when deciding on the final model. We will return to these issues next week.\n\n\nMetric Equivalence\n\nas.data.frame(compare_eth_metric)|&gt;\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nModel\nChi2\nChi2_df\np_Chi2\nBaseline\nBaseline_df\np_Baseline\nGFI\nAGFI\nNFI\nNNFI\nCFI\nRMSEA\nRMSEA_CI_low\nRMSEA_CI_high\np_RMSEA\nRMR\nSRMR\nRFI\nPNFI\nIFI\nRNI\nLoglikelihood\nAIC\nAIC_wt\nBIC\nBIC_wt\nBIC_adjusted\n\n\n\n\none_latent_eth_metric\nlavaan\n1162.4746\n14\n0\n341229.17\n21\n0\n0.9831752\n0.9579381\n0.9965933\n0.9949511\n0.9966341\n0.1027048\n0.0977499\n0.1077479\n0.0000000\n38.29915\n0.0439380\n0.9948899\n0.6643955\n0.9966342\n0.9966341\n-129452.1\n258946.1\n0\n259092.3\n0\n259025.5\n\n\ntwo_latents_eth_metric\nlavaan\n276.7703\n13\n0\n42034.04\n21\n0\n0.9961916\n0.9897467\n0.9934156\n0.9898581\n0.9937217\n0.0510782\n0.0459383\n0.0564019\n0.3560216\n34.17489\n0.0201464\n0.9893636\n0.6149715\n0.9937229\n0.9937217\n-129009.2\n258062.4\n1\n258215.5\n1\n258145.6\n\n\nthree_latents_eth_metric\nlavaan\n701.6287\n12\n0\n27397.50\n21\n0\n0.9906044\n0.9725962\n0.9743908\n0.9559166\n0.9748095\n0.0859629\n0.0806184\n0.0914299\n0.0000000\n76.26852\n0.0358868\n0.9551839\n0.5567947\n0.9748177\n0.9748095\n-129221.6\n258489.3\n0\n258649.3\n0\n258576.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table presents the results of a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) conducted to test metric equivalence (also known as measurement invariance) across different ethnic categories (eth_cat).

    "text": "Methods\n\nConsider any ethical implications.\nExplain the sample. Provide descriptive statistics\nDiscuss inclusion criteria.\nDiscuss how your sample relates to the “source population” (lecture 9.)\nExplain NZAVS measures. State the questions used in the items\nIn your own words describe how the data meet the following assumptions required for causal inference:\nPositivity: Can we intervene on the exposure at all levels of the covariates? Use the code I provided to test whether there is change in the exposure from the baseline in the source population(s)\nConsistency: Can I interpret what it means to intervene on the exposure?\nExchangeability: Are different versions of the exposure conditionally exchangeable given measured baseline confounders? This requires stating baseline confounders and explaining how they may be related to both the exposure and outcome. As part of this, you must explain why the baseline measure of your exposure and outcome are included as potential confounders.\nNote: Unmeasured Confounders: Does previous science suggest the presence of unmeasured confounders? (e.g. childhood exposures that are not measured).\nDraw a causal diagram: Have I drawn a causal diagram (DAG) to highlight both measured and unmeasured sources of confounding?\nMeasurement Error: Have I described potential biases from measurement errors? Return to lecture 11.\nState that you do not have missing data in this synthetic dataset, but that ordinarily missing data would need to be handled.\nState what your estimator will be. Note I’ve given you the following text to modify:\n\n\nThe Doubly Robust Estimation method for Subgroup Analysis Estimator is a sophisticated tool combining features of both IPTW and G-computation methods, providing unbiased estimates if either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. The process involves five main steps:\n\n\nStep 1 involves the estimation of the propensity score, a measure of the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates and the subgroup indicator. This score is calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, with the model choice depending on the nature of the data and exposure. Weights for each individual are then calculated using this propensity score. These weights depend on the exposure status and are computed differently for exposed and unexposed individuals. The estimation of propensity scores is performed separately within each subgroup stratum.\n\n\nStep 2 focuses on fitting a weighted outcome model, making use of the previously calculated weights from the propensity scores. This model estimates the outcome conditional on exposure, covariates, and subgroup, integrating the weights into the estimation process. Unlike in propensity score model estimation, covariates are included as variables in the outcome model. This inclusion makes the method doubly robust - providing a consistent effect estimate if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified, thereby reducing the assumption of correct model specification.\n\n\nStep 3 entails the simulation of potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup. These hypothetical scenarios assume universal exposure to the intervention within each subgroup, regardless of actual exposure levels. The expectation of potential outcomes is calculated for each individual in each subgroup, using individual-specific weights. These scenarios are performed for both the current and alternative interventions.\n\n\nStep 4 is the estimation of the average causal effect for each subgroup, achieved by comparing the computed expected values of potential outcomes under each intervention level. The difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure within each subgroup.\n\n\nStep 5 involves comparing differences in causal effects across groups by calculating the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups. Confidence intervals and standard errors for these calculations are determined using simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023). This step allows for a comprehensive comparison of the impact of different interventions across various subgroups, while encorporating uncertainty.\n\n\n\nState what E-values are and how you will use them to clarify the risk of unmeasured confounding."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nUse the scripts I have provided as a template for your analysis.\nPropensity Score Reporting: Detail the process of propensity score derivation, including the model used and any variable transformations: e.g.: A ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + .... using logistic regression, all continuous predictors were transformed to z-scores\n\nWeightIt Package Utilisation: Explicitly mention the use of the ‘WeightIt’ package in R, including any specific options or parameters used in the propensity score estimation process (Greifer 2023).\nReport if different methods were used to obtain propensity scores, and the reasons behind the choice of methods such as ‘ebal’, ‘energy’, and ‘ps’.\nIf your exposure is continuous only the ‘energy’ option was used for propensity score estimation.\nSubgroup Estimation: Confirm that the propensity scores for subgroups were estimated separately, and discuss how the weights were subsequently combined with the original data.\nCovariate Balance: Include a Love plot to visually represent covariate balance on the exposure both before and after weighting. The script will generate these plots.\nWeighting Algorithm Statistics: Report the statistics for the weighting algorithms as provided by the WeightIt package, including any measures of balance or fit. The script I gave you will generate this information\n\n\nExample:\n\nWe estimated propensity scores by fitting a model for the exposure A as it is predicted by the set of baseline covariates defined by L. Because we are interested in effect modification by group, we fit different propensity score models for within strata of G using the subgroup command of the WeightIt package. Thus the propensity score is the the probability of receiving a value of a treatment (A=a) conditional on the covariates L, and stratum within G. We compared balance using the following methods of weighting: “ebal” or entropy balancing, “energy” or energy balancing, and “ps” or traditional inverse probability of weighting balancing. Of these methods “ebal” performed the best. Table X and Figure Y present the results of the ebalancing method.\n\n\nInterpretation of Propensity Scores: we interpret the proposensity scores as yeilding good balance across the exposure conditions.\nOutcome Regression Model: Clearly report the type of regression model used to estimate outcome model coefficients (e.g., linear regression, Poisson, binomial), and mention if the exposure was interacted with the baseline covariates. Do not report model coefficients as these have no interpretation. Example\n\n\nWe fit a linear model using maximum likelihood estimation with the outcome Y predicted by the exposure A. We interacted the exposure with all baseline confounders L. Continuous baseline confounders were converted to z-scores, whereas categorical exposures were not. Also interacted with all baseline confounders was a term for the subgroup interactoin. This allowed uas to flexibily fit non-linearities for the modification of the effect of the exposure within levels of the levels of the cultural group strata of interest. We note that model coefficients have no interpretation in this context so are not reported. The remaining steps of Doubly-Robust estimation were performed as outlined in the Method section. We calculated confidence intervals and standard errors, using the clarify package in R, which relies on simulation based inference for these quantities of interest (Greifer et al. 2023)\n\n\nReport the causal estimates.\n\nATE contrasts for groups in setting the exposure to for each group in setting level A = a and A = a*\ndifferences between groups in the magnitude of the effects. (ATE_group 1 - ATE_group_2)\n\nReport the E-value: how sensitive are your results to unmeasured confounding? Hint I gave you code that will create a table for you: See here\n\ntable_depression &lt;- tab_ate_subgroup_rd(table_estimates_depression, delta = 1, sd = 1)"

Data wrangling is the majority of data analysis. The good news is that R makes wrangling relatively straightforward.\n\nmutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))): This creates a new column called id that has unique identification factors for each row in the dataset. It ranges from 1 to the number of rows in the dataset.\nThe next mutate operation is used to convert the t0_eth_cat, t0_urban, and t0_gen_cohort variables to factor type, if they are not already.\nThe filter command is used to subset the dataset to only include rows where the t0_eth_cat is either “euro” or “māori”. The original dataset includes data with four different ethnic categories. This command filters out any row not related to these two groups.\nungroup() ensures that there’s no grouping in the dataframe.\nThe mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) step standardizes all numeric columns in the dataset by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (a z-score transformation). The resulting columns are renamed to include “_z” at the end of their original names.\nThe select function is used to keep only specific columns: the id column, any columns that are factors, and any columns that end in “_z”.\nThe relocate functions re-order columns. The first relocate places the id column at the beginning. The next three relocate functions order the rest of the columns based on their names: those starting with “t0_” are placed before “t1_” columns, and those starting with “t2_” are placed after “t1_” columns.\ndroplevels() removes unused factor levels in the dataframe.\nFinally, skimr::skim(dt) will print out a summary of the data in the dt object using the skimr package. This provides a useful overview of the data, including data types and summary statistics.\n\nThis function seems to be part of a data preparation pipeline in a longitudinal or panel analysis, where observations are ordered over time (indicated by t0_, t1_, t2_, etc.).\n\n### ### ### ### ### ### SUBGROUP DATA ANALYSIS: DATA WRANGLING  ### ### ### ###\n\ndt &lt;- dt_prepare|&gt;\n  mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n  t0_eth_cat = as.factor(t0_eth_cat),\n  t0_urban = as.factor(t0_urban),\n  t0_gen_cohort = as.factor(t0_gen_cohort)\n) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(t0_eth_cat == \"euro\" |\n                t0_eth_cat == \"māori\") |&gt; # Too few asian and pacific\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  # transform numeric variables into z scores (improves estimation)\n  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) %&gt;%\n  # select only factors and numeric values that are z-scores\n  select(id, # category is too sparse\n         where(is.factor),\n         ends_with(\"_z\"), ) |&gt;\n  # tidy data frame so that the columns are ordered by time (useful for more complex models)\n  relocate(id, .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))   |&gt;\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t0_\"), .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))  |&gt;\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t2_\"), .after = starts_with(\"t1_\")) |&gt;\n  droplevels()\n\n\n# checks\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_depression_z)\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_anxiety_z)\n\ndt |&gt;\n  tabyl(t0_eth_cat, t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ) |&gt;\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n# Visualise missingness\nnaniar::vis_miss(dt)\n\n# save your dataframe for future use\n\n# make dataframe\ndt = as.data.frame(dt)\n\n# save data\nsaveRDS(dt, here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n\nCalculate propensity scores\nNext we generate propensity scores.\n\n# read  data -- you may start here if you need to repeat the analysis\ndt &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n# get column names\nbaseline_vars_reflective_propensity &lt;- dt|&gt;\n  dplyr::select(starts_with(\"t0\"), -t0_eth_cat) |&gt; colnames()\n\n# define our exposure\nX &lt;- \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen\"\n\n# define subclasses\nS &lt;- \"t0_eth_cat\"\n\n# Make sure data is in a data frame format\ndt &lt;- data.frame(dt)\n\n\n# next we use our trick for creating a formula string, which will reduce our work\nformula_str_prop &lt;-\n  paste(X,\n        \"~\",\n        paste(baseline_vars_reflective_propensity, collapse = \"+\"))\n\n# this shows the exposure variable as predicted by the baseline confounders.\nformula_str_prop\n\n[1] \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ~ t0_male+t0_gen_cohort+t0_urban+t0_hours_exercise_coarsen+t0_edu_z+t0_employed_z+t0_nz_dep2018_z+t0_nzsei13_z+t0_partner_z+t0_parent_z+t0_pol_orient_z+t0_agreeableness_z+t0_conscientiousness_z+t0_extraversion_z+t0_honesty_humility_z+t0_openness_z+t0_neuroticism_z+t0_modesty_z+t0_religion_identification_level_z+t0_hours_exercise_log_z+t0_kessler_latent_anxiety_z+t0_kessler_latent_depression_z\"\n\n\nFor propensity score analysis, we will try several different approaches. We will want to select the method that produces the best balance.\nI typically use ps (classical propensity scores), ebal and energy. The latter two in my experience yeild good balance. Also energy will work with continuous exposures.\nFor more information, see https://ngreifer.github.io/WeightIt/\n\n# traditional propensity scores-- note we select the ATT and we have a subgroup \ndt_match_ps &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  method = \"ps\"\n)\n\nsaveRDS(dt_match_ps, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ps\"))\n\n\n# ebalance\ndt_match_ebal &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  method = \"ebal\"\n)\n\n# save output\nsaveRDS(dt_match_ebal, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ebal\"))\n\n\n\n## energy balance method\ndt_match_energy &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  #focal = \"high\", # for use with ATT\n  method = \"energy\"\n)\nsaveRDS(dt_match_energy, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy\"))\n\nResults, first for Europeans\n\n#dt_match_energy &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy\"))\ndt_match_ebal &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ebal\"))\n#dt_match_ps &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ps\"))\n\n# next we inspect balance. \"Max.Diff.Adj\" should ideally be less than .05, but less than .1 is ok.

Of these approaches, entropy balancing provided the best balance. The results indicate an excellent balance across all variables, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold of 0.05 across a range of binary and continuous baseline confounders, including gender, generation cohort, urban_location, exercise hours (coarsened, baseline), education, employment status, depression, anxiety, and various personality traits. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs.\n\n\nThe effective sample sizes were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 2880, 3927, and 1834, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 1855.89, 3659.59, and 1052.01, respectively.\n\n\nThe weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2310 to 7.0511) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.5769 to 1.9603). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n\nWe also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n\nWe plotted these results using love plots, visually confirming both the balance in the propensity score model using entropy balanced weights, and the imbalance in the model that does not adjust for baseline confounders.\n\n\nOverall, these findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, conditional on the measured covariates included in the model.\n\n\n\nExample Summary Maori Propensity scores.\nResults:\n\nThe entropy balancing method was also the best performing method that was applied to a subgroup analysis of the Māori population. Similar to the NZ European subgroup analysis, the method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup.\n\n\nThe effective sample sizes for the Māori subgroup were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 307, 354, and 160, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 220.54, 321.09, and 76.39, respectively\n\n\nThe weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups in the Māori subgroup varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2213 to 3.8101) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.3995 to 1.9800). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n\nThe study also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group for the Māori subgroup. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the results of the Māori subgroup analysis are consistent with the overall analysis. The entropy balancing method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold. These findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, even in subgroup analyses.\n\n\n\nMore data wrangling\nNote that we need to attach the weights from the propensity score model back to the data.\nHowever, because our weighting analysis estimates a model for the exposure, we only need to do this analysis once, no matter how many outcomes we investigate. So there’s a little good news.\n\n# prepare nz_euro data\ndt&lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\")) # original data subset only nz europeans\n\ndt_ref_e &lt;- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"euro\") # original data subset only nz europeans\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_e$weights &lt;- dt_match_ebal$euro$weights # get weights from the ps matching model,add to data\n\n# prepare maori data\ndt_ref_m &lt;- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"māori\")# original data subset only maori\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_m$weights &lt;- dt_match_ebal$māori$weights # get weights from the ps matching model, add to data\n\n# combine data into one data frame\ndt_ref_all &lt;- rbind(dt_ref_e, dt_ref_m) # combine the data into one dataframe. \n\n# save data for later use, if needed\nsaveRDS(dt_ref_all, here::here(\"data\",\"dt_ref_all\"))"

This is suggested by the estimated risk difference (RD_m - RD_e) of 0.068. However, there is a degree of uncertainty in this estimate, as the confidence interval (-0.09 to 0.229) crosses zero. This suggests that we cannot be confident that the difference in depression reduction between New Zealand Europeans and Māori is statistically significant. It’s possible that the true difference could be zero or even negative, implying a greater depression reduction for Māori than New Zealand Europeans. Thus, while the results hint at a larger depression reduction for New Zealand Europeans, the uncertainty in this estimate urges us to interpret this difference with caution.\n\n\n\nDiscusion\nYou’ll need to do this yourself. Here’s a start:\n\nIn our study, we employed a robust statistical method that helps us estimate the impact of exercise on reducing anxiety among different population groups – New Zealand Europeans and Māori. This method has the advantage of providing reliable results even if our underlying assumptions aren’t entirely accurate – a likely scenario given the complexity of real-world data. However, this robustness comes with a trade-off: it gives us wider ranges of uncertainty in our estimates. This doesn’t mean the analysis is flawed; rather, it accurately represents our level of certainty given the data we have.\n\n\nExercise and Anxiety\n\nOur analysis suggests that exercise may have a greater effect in reducing anxiety among New Zealand Europeans compared to Māori. This conclusion comes from our primary causal estimate, the risk difference, which is 0.104. However, it’s crucial to consider our uncertainty in this value. We represent this uncertainty as a range, also known as a confidence interval. In this case, the interval ranges from -0.042 to 0.279. What this means is, given our current data and method, the true effect could plausibly be anywhere within this range. While our best estimate shows a higher reduction in anxiety for New Zealand Europeans, the range of plausible values includes zero and even negative values. This implies that the true effect could be no difference between the two groups or even a higher reduction in Māori. Hence, while there’s an indication of a difference, we should interpret it cautiously given the wide range of uncertainty.\n\n\nThus, although our analysis points towards a potential difference in how exercise reduces anxiety among these groups, the level of uncertainty means we should be careful about drawing firm conclusions. More research is needed to further explore these patterns.\n\n\n\nExercise and Depression\n\nIn addition to anxiety, we also examined the effect of exercise on depression. We do not find evidence for reduction of depression from exercise in either group. We do not find evidence for the effect of weekly exercise – as self-reported – on depression.\n\n\n\nProviso\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that statistical results are only one piece of a larger scientific puzzle about the relationship between excercise and well-being. Other pieces include understanding the context, incorporating subject matter knowledge, and considering the implications of the findings. In the present study, wide confidence intervals suggest the possibility of considerable individual differences.\\dots nevertheless, \\dots\n\nAgain, you will need to come up with your own discussion, but follow the step-by-step instructions above as a guide."

    "section": "Step 1: State a causal question",
    "text": "Step 1: State a causal question\nStating a causal question requires describing: a. outcome(s), b. exposure, c. measured confounders, d. (suspected) unmeasured confounders, e. scale of causal contrasts, f. target population for whom the inferences apply.\nWe consider each of these processes in turn.\n\na. Identify the outcome(s) of interest\nWe use Y to denote an outcome of interest. This is the “effect” of interest.\n\nConsider:\n\nThe outcome might be binary (severely distressed/not severely distressed), continuous (the average of the sum of the indicators), or a rate variable (the sum of the indicators).\nIt is crucial to specify the units in which the outcome is measured.\nTransforming the outcome into standard deviation units can be beneficial.\nThe outcome must occur after the exposure or treatment.\nWe must designate a time period within which the outcome occurs, e.g, “the one-year effect of a treatment on well-being as measured by Kessler-6.”\nWe may be interested in multiple outcomes. This is the rational behind outcomewide science [cite tyler]\nWe must remember that the outcome might be measured with error, that such errors may be affected by the treatment or correlated with the measurement error of the treatment. (A topic of future seminars, which we will set to the side for now)\n\nHere, imagine we are interested in understanding only one outcome in our study: well-being as measured by the Kessler-6 depression/anxiety scale.\n\n\n\nb. Define the exposure or intervention\nWe use A to denote the the exposure or treatment. This is the variable that we hypothesise might affect the outcome. This variable denotes the cause of interest. We will restrict our focus to consider in which there is only one treatment (i.e. we will not consider complex multi-treatment regimes.)\nHere, imagine we are interested in understanding the causal effect of ‘Church attendance’.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y, A must occur before Y.\nWhat does A indicate? We may characterise ‘Church Attendance’ as a binary exposure (attend/not attend) or as a continuous exposure (attend weekly/attend monthly). The exposure, in this instance, remains nebulous until we delineate the unit change in A we are interested in investigating.\nFor theoretical and practical purpose we might want to trunctate the variable into categories: (none/some; none/less than weekly, weekly or more)… Why? Because our causal question requires stating the contrast between the states of the world in which we are interested. Additionally, experts often make decisions on the basis of discrete thresholds (has risk of depression/does not).\nWe must remember that an exposure or treatment might be measured with error, that such errors might be correlated with the measurement error of the outcome or affect it. (Again, a topic of future seminars, which we will set to the side for now).\n\n\n\n\nc. Identify pre-exposure covariates for confounding control\nWe use L to denote the set of measured baseline confounders of the the exposure-outcome association. For a three-wave panel design, we employ VanderWeele’s modified disjunctive cause criterion, we advises: control for any covariate that is a cause of the exposure, the outcome, or both, excluding any instrumental variable and incorporating any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y, L must occur before Y.\n\nTo affect A, L must occur before A.\nAlthough we may gain precision by including an L that affects Y but is unrelated to A, including variables that occur after A will be hazardous if it is possible that A affects L (or its measurement).\nA useful set of default counfounders in NZAVS studies is given in your workbooks.\nNote we have left out the concept of “selection bias.” There are indeed sources of bias that may occure after A. This is another topic for the week ahead.\n\n\n\n\nd. Highlight unmeasured pre-treatment covariates\nLet U denoted unmeasured pre-treatment covariates that may potentially bias the statistical association between A and Y independently of the measured covariates.\n\nConsider:\n\nTo affect Y and A, U must occur before A.\nIt is useful to draw a causal diagramme to illustrate all potential sources of bias.\nCausal diagrammes are qualitative tools that require specialist expertise. We cannot typically obtain a causal graph from the data.\nA causal diagramme should include only as much information as is required to assess confounding. See ?@fig-dag-outcomewide for an example.\nBecause we cannot ensure the absence of unmeasured confounders in observational settings, it is vital to conduct sensitivity analyses for the results. For sensitivity analyeses, we use E-values, a topic for a latter seminar.\n\n\n\n\nChoose the scale for a causal contrast\nAverage causal effects can be inferred by contrasting the expected outcome when a population is exposed to an exposure level, E[Y(A = a)], with the expected outcome under a different exposure level, E[Y(A=a')].\nFor a binary treatment with levels A=0 and A=1, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), on the difference scale, is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]\nOn the risk ratio scale, the ATE is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}\nOther effect scales, such as the incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio, might also be of interest. We can also define the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) :\nATT_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|A=1,L]\nATT_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|A=1,L]}{E[Y(0)|A=1, L]}\nAnother common estimand is the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE), which denotes the effect the treatment would have on the entire population if applied universally to that population. This quantity can be expressed:\nPATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = f(E[Y(1) - Y(0)|L], W)\nPATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = f\\left(\\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}, W\\right)\nwhere f is a function that incorporates weights W into the estimation of the expected outcomes. These weights may correspond to the inverse probability of being sampled or in the case of NZAVS data, the survey weights are given from census estimates for the wider population. Note: I will show you how to use weights in future seminars.\nWe might also be interested in identifying effects specific to certain strata, such as risk differences or risk ratios, as they are modified by baseline indicators. Denote a stratum of interest by S. We may then compute:\nATE_{S,\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|S, L]\nATE_{S,\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|S, L]}{E[Y(0)|S, L]}\n\nConsider:\n\n** In this course, we are interested in stratum specific comparisons **\nIn the causal inference literature, the concept we use to make sense of stratum specific comparisons is called “effect modification.”\nBy inferring effects within stratums, we may evaluate whether the effects of different exposures or treatments on some well-defined outcome (measured in some well-defined time-period after the exposure) differ depending on group measurement.\nThe logic of effect modification differs from that of intereaction.\n\n\n\nAside: extensions\nFor continuous exposures, we must stipulate the level of contrast for the exposure (e.g. weekly versus monthly church attendance):\nATE_{A,A'} = E[Y(A) - Y(A')| L]\nThis essentially denotes an average treatment effect comparing the outcome under treatment level A to the outcome under treatment level A'.\nLikewise:\nATE_{A/A'} = \\frac{E[Y(A)| L]}{E[Y(A')| L]}\nThis defines the contrast of A and A' on a ratio scale.\n\n\nf. Describe the population(s) for whom the intended study is meant to generalise.\nThe potential outcomes literature in causal inference distinguishes between the concepts of generalisability and transportability.\n\nGeneralisability refers to the ability to apply the causal effects estimated from a sample to the population it was drawn from. In simpler terms, it deals with the extrapolation of causal knowledge from a sample to the broader population. This concept is also called “external validity”.\n\n\\text{Generalizability} = PATE \\approx ATE_{\\text{sample}}\n\nTransportability refers to the ability to extrapolate causal effects learned from a source population to a target population when certain conditions are met. It deals with the transfer of causal knowledge across different settings or populations.\n\n\\text{Transportability} = ATE_{\\text{target}} \\approx f(ATE_{\\text{source}}, T)\nwhere f is a function and T is a function that maps the results from our source population to another population. To achieve transportability, we need information about the source and target populations and an understanding of how the relationships between treatment, outcome, and covariates differ between the populations. Assessing transportability requires scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\nSummary Step 1: Consider how much we need to do when asking a causal question!\nWe discover that asking a causal question is a multifaceted task. It demands careful definition of the outcome, including its timing, the exposure, and covariates. It also requires selecting the appropriate scale for causal contrast, controlling for confounding, and potentially adjusting for sample weights or stratification. Finally, when asking a causal question, we must consider for whom the results apply. Only after following these steps can we then ask: “How may we answer this causal question?”"

    "section": "STEP 2: ANSWER A CAUSAL QUESTION",
    "text": "STEP 2: ANSWER A CAUSAL QUESTION\n\nObtain longitudinal data\nNote that causal inference from observational data turns on the appropriate temporal ordering of the key variables involved in the study.\nRecall we have defined.\n\nA: Our exposure or treatment variable, denoted as A. Here we consider the example of ‘Church attendance’.\nY: The outcome variable we are interested in, represented by Y, is psychological distress. We operationalise this variable through the ‘Kessler-6’ distress scale.\nL: The confounding variables, collectively referred to as L, represent factors that can independently influence both A and Y. For example, socio-economic status could be a confounder that impacts both the likelihood of church attendance and the levels of psychological distress.\n\nGiven the importance of temporal ordering, we must now define time:\n\nt \\in T: Let t denote within a multiwave panel study with T measurement intervals.\n\nWhere t/\\text{{exposure}} denotes the measurement interval for the exposure. Longitudinal data collection provides us the ability to establish a causal model such that: t\\text{{baseline}}/\\mathbf{L} &lt; t\\text{{exposure}}/\\text{{A}} &lt; t\\text{{exposure}}/\\mathbf{Y}.\nTo minimise the posibility of time-varying confounding and obtain the clearest effect estimates, we should acquire the most recent values of \\mathbf{L} preceding A and the latest values of A before Y such that: t\\text{{0}}/\\mathbf{L} &lt; t\\text{{1}}/\\text{{A}} &lt; t\\text{{2}}/\\mathbf{Y}.\n\n\nInclude the measured outcome with baseline covariates\nControlling for previous outcome is crucial because the outcome at baseline is often the most potent confounder of both the exposure post-exposure-outcome association.\n\n\nInclude the measured exposure with baseline covariates\nControlling for prior exposure enables the interpretation of the effect estimate as a change in the exposure in a manner akin to a randomised trial. We propose that the effect estimate with prior control for the exposure estimates the “incidence exposure” rather than the “prevalence exposure” [Hernan Danaei, Tavakkoli and Hernán, 2012, Hernán, 2015]. It is crucial to estimate the incidence exposure because if the effects of an exposure are harmful in the short term such that these effects are not subsequently measured, a failure to adjust for prior exposure will yield the illusion that the exposure is beneficial. Furthermore, this approach aids in controlling for unmeasured confounding. For such a confounder to dismiss the observed exposure-outcome association, it would need to do so independently of the prior level of the exposure and outcome.\n\n\nState the eligibility criteria for participation\nThis step is invaluable for assessing whether we are answering the causal question that we have asked.\n\nConsider:\n\nGeneralisability: we cannot evaluate inferences to a target group from the source popuation if we do not describe the source population\nEligibility criteria will help us to ensure whether we have correctly evaluated potential measurement bias/error in our instruments.\n\nFor example, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a National Probability study of New Zealanders. The details provided in the supplementary materials describe how individuals were randomly selected from the country’s electoral roll. From these invitations there was typically less than 15% response rate. How might this process of recruitment affect generalisability and transportability of our results?\n\n(Aside: discuss per protocol effects/ intention to treat effects)\n\n\n\n\nHandling of missing data\n\nAs we will consider in the upcoming weeks, loss to follow up and non-response opens sources for bias. We must develop a strategy for handling missing data.\n\n\n\nState a statistical model\nThe models we have considered in this course are G-computation, Inverse Probability of Treatement Weighting, and Doubly-Robust estimation.\n:\n\nG-computation for Subgroup Analysis Algorithm\nStep 1 Estimate the outcome model. Fit a model for the outcome Y, conditional on both the exposure A, the covariates L, and subgroup indicator G. This model can be linear regression, logistic regression, or another statistical model. The goal is to capture the relationship between the outcome, exposure, confounders, and subgroups.\n E(Y|A,L,G) = f_Y(A,L,G; \\theta_Y) \nThis equation represents the expected value of the outcome Y given the exposure A, covariates L, and subgroup G as modeled by the function f_Y with parameters \\theta_Y. This formulation allows for the prediction of the average outcome Y given certain values of A, L, and G.\nStep 2 Simulate potential outcomes. For each individual i in each subgroup g, predict their potential outcome \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a) under the intervention A=a, and \\hat{Y}_{i,g}(a^{\\prime}) under the intervention A=a^{\\prime}, using the estimated outcome model. This is done by replacing the observed value of the exposure A in the outcome model with the counterfactual exposure values a and a^{\\prime}, while keeping the values of the covariates L and subgroup G unchanged:\n[_{i,g}(a) = E[Y|A=a,L_i,G=g; _Y]]\n[_{i,g}(a^{}) = E[Y|A=a^{},L_i,G=g; _Y]]\nThis step involves simulating the outcomes under each intervention level for every individual within each subgroup, as if they were exposed to treatment level a or a^{\\prime}.\nStep 3 Estimate the average causal effect for each subgroup. Compute the expected value of the potential outcomes under each intervention level for each subgroup g:\n[E[Y(a)|G=g] = {G_i=g}^N {i,g}(a)]\n[E[Y(a^{})|G=g] = {G_i=g}^N {i,g}(a^{})]\nand calculate the difference for each subgroup g:\n[_g = E[Y(a)|G=g] - E[Y(a^{})|G=g]]\nThis difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level a^{\\prime} to level a within subgroup g.\nTo obtain the standard errors and confidence intervals for the subgroup-specific causal effects, simulation-based inference methods, such as the clarify package[@greifer2023], can be used.\n\n\n\nWhat we have not done\nWe have not addressed: - measurement error. Our graphs do not incorporate it. - selection bias - Outcome-wide studies - Sampling weights."

We cannot typically obtain a causal graph from the data.\nA causal diagramme should include only as much information as is required to assess confounding. See Figure 7 for an example.\nBecause we cannot ensure the absence of unmeasured confounders in observational settings, it is vital to conduct sensitivity analyses for the results. For sensitivity analyeses, we use E-values, a topic for a latter seminar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Causal graph: three-wave panel design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne. Choose the scale for a causal contrast\nAverage causal effects can be inferred by contrasting the expected outcome when a population is exposed to an exposure level, E[Y(A = a)], with the expected outcome under a different exposure level, E[Y(A=a')].\nFor a binary treatment with levels A=0 and A=1, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), on the difference scale, is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]\nOn the risk ratio scale, the ATE is expressed:\nATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}\nOther effect scales, such as the incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio, might also be of interest. We can also define the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) :\nATT_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|A=1,L]\nATT_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|A=1,L]}{E[Y(0)|A=1, L]}\nAnother common estimand is the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE), which denotes the effect the treatment would have on the entire population if applied universally to that population. This quantity can be expressed:\nPATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = f(E[Y(1) - Y(0)|L], W)\nPATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = f\\left(\\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}, W\\right)\nwhere f is a function that incorporates weights W into the estimation of the expected outcomes. These weights are given from census estimates for the wider population. Note: I will show you how to use weights in future seminars.\nWe might also be interested in identifying effects specific to certain strata, such as risk differences or risk ratios, as they are modified by baseline indicators. Denote a stratum of interest by G. We may then compute:\nATE_{G,\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|G, L]\nATE_{G,\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|G, L]}{E[Y(0)|G, L]}\n\nConsider:\n\nIn this course, we are interested in stratum specific comparisons\nIn the causal inference literature, the concept we use to make sense of stratum specific comparisons is called “effect modification.”\nBy inferring effects within stratums, we may evaluate whether the effects of different exposures or treatments on some well-defined outcome (measured in some well-defined time-period after the exposure) differ depending on group measurement.\nThe logic of effect modification differs slightly from that of interaction.\n\n\n\nAside: extensions\nFor continuous exposures, we must stipulate the level of contrast for the exposure (e.g. weekly versus monthly church attendance):\nATE_{A,A'} = E[Y(A) - Y(A')| L]\nThis essentially denotes an average treatment effect comparing the outcome under treatment level A to the outcome under treatment level A'.\nLikewise:\nATE_{A/A'} = \\frac{E[Y(A)| L]}{E[Y(A')| L]}\nThis defines the contrast of A and A' on a ratio scale.\n\n\nf. Describe the population(s) for whom the intended study is meant to generalise by distinguishing between source and target populations.\nConsider the following concepts:\n\nSource population: A source population is where we gather our data for a study. We pull our specific sample from this group. It needs to mirror the broader group for our conclusions to be valid and widely applicable.\nTarget population: The target population is the larger group we aim to apply our study’s results to. It could be defined by location, demographics, or specific conditions. The closer the source matches the target in ways that are relevant to our causal questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target population will be.\n\nGeneralisability refers to the ability to apply the causal effects estimated from a sample to the population it was drawn from. In simpler terms, it deals with the extrapolation of causal knowledge from a sample to the broader population. This concept is also called “external validity”.\n\n\n\\text{Generalisability} = PATE \\approx ATE_{\\text{sample}}\n\nTransportability refers to the ability to extrapolate causal effects learned from a source population to a target population when certain conditions are met. It deals with the transfer of causal knowledge across different settings or populations.\n\n\\text{Transportability} = ATE_{\\text{target}} \\approx f(ATE_{\\text{source}}, T)\nwhere f is a function and T is a function that maps the results from our source population to another population. To achieve transportability, we need information about the source and target populations and an understanding of how the relationships between treatment, outcome, and covariates differ between the populations. Assessing transportability requires scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\nSummary Step 1: Consider how much we need to do when asking a causal question!\nWe discover that asking a causal question is a multifaceted task. It demands careful definition of the outcome, including its timing, the exposure, and covariates. It also requires selecting the appropriate scale for causal contrast, controlling for confounding, and potentially adjusting for sample weights or stratification. Finally, when asking a causal question, we must consider for whom the results apply. Only after following these steps can we then ask: “How may we answer this causal question?”"

    "section": "STEP 2: ANSWER A CAUSAL QUESTION",
    "text": "STEP 2: ANSWER A CAUSAL QUESTION\n\nObtain longitudinal data\nNote that causal inference from observational data turns on the appropriate temporal ordering of the key variables involved in the study.\nRecall we have defined.\n\nA: Our exposure or treatment variable, denoted as A. Here we consider the example of ‘Church attendance’.\nY: The outcome variable we are interested in, represented by Y, is psychological distress. We operationalise this variable through the ‘Kessler-6’ distress scale.\nL: The confounding variables, collectively referred to as L, represent factors that can independently influence both A and Y. For example, socio-economic status could be a confounder that impacts both the likelihood of church attendance and the levels of psychological distress.\n\nGiven the importance of temporal ordering, we must now define time:\n\nt \\in T: Let t denote within a multiwave panel study with T measurement intervals.\n\nWhere t/\\text{{exposure}} denotes the measurement interval for the exposure. Longitudinal data collection provides us the ability to establish a causal model such that:\nt_{confounders} &lt; t_{exposure}&lt; t_{outcome}\nTo minimise the posibility of time-varying confounding and obtain the clearest effect estimates, we should acquire the most recent values of \\mathbf{L} preceding A and the latest values of A before Y.\nNote in Figure 7, We use the prefixes “t0, t1, and t2” to denote temporal ordering. We include in the set of baseline confounders the pre-exposure measurement of A and Y. This allows for more substantial confounding control. For unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure and the outcome, it would need to do so independently of the pre-exposure confounders. Additionally, including the baseline exposure gives us an effect estimate for the incidence exposure, rather than the prevelance of the exposure. This helps us to assess the expected change in the outcome were we to initate a change in the exposure.\n\n\nInclude the measured exposure with baseline covariates\nControlling for prior exposure enables the interpretation of the effect estimate as a change in the exposure in a manner akin to a randomised trial. We propose that the effect estimate with prior control for the exposure estimates the “incidence exposure” rather than the “prevalence exposure” (Danaei, Tavakkoli, and Hernán 2012). It is crucial to estimate the incidence exposure because if the effects of an exposure are harmful in the short term such that these effects are not subsequently measured, a failure to adjust for prior exposure will yield the illusion that the exposure is beneficial. Furthermore, this approach aids in controlling for unmeasured confounding. For such a confounder to explain away the observed exposure-outcome association, it would need to do so independently of the prior level of the exposure and outcome.\n\n\nState the eligibility criteria for participation\nThis step is invaluable for assessing whether we are answering the causal question that we have asked.\n\nConsider:\n\nGeneralisability: we cannot evaluate inferences to a target group from the source population if we do not describe the source population\nEligibility criteria will help us to ensure whether we have correctly evaluated potential measurement bias/error in our instruments.\n\nFor example, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a National Probability study of New Zealanders. The details provided in the supplementary materials describe how individuals were randomly selected from the country’s electoral roll. From these invitations there was typically less than 15% response rate. How might this process of recruitment affect generalisability and transportability of our results?\n\nAside: discuss per protocol effects/ intention to treat effects\n\n\n\n\nDetermine how missing data will be handled\n\nAs we will consider in the upcoming weeks, loss to follow up and non-response opens sources for bias. We must develop a strategy for handling missing data.\n\n\n\nState a statistical model\nThe models we have considered in this course are G-computation, Inverse Probability of Treatement Weighting, and Doubly-Robust estimation.\n\n\nReporting\nConsider the following ideas about how to report one’s model:\n\nEstimator: Doubly robust where possible.\nPropensity Score Reporting: Detail the process of propensity score derivation, including the model used and any variable transformations.\nWeightIt Package Utilisation: Explicitly mention the use of the ‘WeightIt’ package in R, including any specific options or parameters used in the propensity score estimation process.\nMethod Variations: Report if different methods were used to obtain propensity scores, and the reasons behind the choice of methods such as ‘ebal’, ‘energy’, and ‘ps’.\nContinuous Exposures: Highlight that for continuous exposures, only the ‘energy’ option was used for propensity score estimation.\nSubgroup Estimation: Confirm that the propensity scores for subgroups were estimated separately, and discuss how the weights were subsequently combined with the original data.\nCovariate Balance: Include a Love plot to visually represent covariate balance on the exposure both before and after weighting.\nWeighting Algorithm Statistics: Report the statistics for the weighting algorithms as provided by the WeightIt package, including any measures of balance or fit.\nOutcome Regression Model: Clearly report the type of regression model used to estimate outcome model coefficients (e.g., linear regression, Poisson, binomial), and mention if the exposure was interacted with the baseline covariates. Do not report model coefficients as these have no interpretation.\nSubgroup Interaction: Address whether the subgroup was included separately as an interaction in the outcome model, and if the model successfully converged.\nModel Coefficients: Note that the model coefficients should not be interpreted, as they are not meaningful in this context.\nConfidence Intervals and Standard Errors: Describe the methods used to derive confidence intervals and standard errors, noting the use of the ‘clarify’ package in R for simulation based inference.\n\n\n\nExample of how to report a doubly robust method in your report\nThe Doubly Robust Estimation method for Subgroup Analysis Estimator is a sophisticated tool combining features of both IPTW and G-computation methods, providing unbiased estimates if either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. The process involves five main steps:\nStep 1 involves the estimation of the propensity score, a measure of the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates and the subgroup indicator. This score is calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, with the model choice depending on the nature of the data and exposure. Weights for each individual are then calculated using this propensity score. These weights depend on the exposure status and are computed differently for exposed and unexposed individuals. The estimation of propensity scores is performed separately within each subgroup stratum.\nStep 2 focuses on fitting a weighted outcome model, making use of the previously calculated weights from the propensity scores. This model estimates the outcome conditional on exposure, covariates, and subgroup, integrating the weights into the estimation process. Unlike in propensity score model estimation, covariates are included as variables in the outcome model. This inclusion makes the method doubly robust - providing a consistent effect estimate if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified, thereby reducing the assumption of correct model specification.\nStep 3 entails the simulation of potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup. These hypothetical scenarios assume universal exposure to the intervention within each subgroup, regardless of actual exposure levels. The expectation of potential outcomes is calculated for each individual in each subgroup, using individual-specific weights. These scenarios are performed for both the current and alternative interventions.\nStep 4 is the estimation of the average causal effect for each subgroup, achieved by comparing the computed expected values of potential outcomes under each intervention level. The difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure within each subgroup.\nStep 5 involves comparing differences in causal effects across groups by calculating the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups. Confidence intervals and standard errors for these calculations are determined using simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023). This step allows for a comprehensive comparison of the impact of different interventions across various subgroups, while encorporating uncertainty.\n\n\nInference\nConsider the following ideas about what to discuss in one’s findings: Consider the following ideas about what to discuss in one’s findings. The order of exposition might be different.\n\nSummary of results: What did you find?\nInterpretation of E-values: Interpret the E-values used for sensitivity analysis. State what they represent in terms of the robustness of the findings to potential unmeasured confounding.\nCausal Effect Interpretation: What is the interest of the effect, if any, if an effect was observed? Interpret the average causal effect of changing the exposure level within each subgroup, and discuss its relevance to the research question.\nComparison of Subgroups: Discuss how differences in causal effect estimates between different subgroups, if observed, or if not observed, contribute to the overall findings of the study.\nUncertainty and Confidence Intervals: Consider the uncertainty around the estimated causal effects, and interpret the confidence intervals to understand the precision of the estimates.\nGeneralisability and Transportability: Reflect on the generalizability of the study results to other contexts or populations. Discuss any factors that might influence the transportability of the causal effects found in the study. (Again see lecture 9.)\nAssumptions and Limitations: Reflect on the assumptions made during the study and identify any limitations in the methodology that could affect the interpretation of results. State that the implications of different intervention levels on potential outcomes are not analysed.\nTheoretical Relevance: How are these findings relevant to existing theories.\nReplication and Future Research: Consider how the study could be replicated or expanded upon in future research, and how the findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field.\nReal-world Implications: Discuss the real-world implications of the findings, and how they could be applied in policy, practice, or further research."

Provide descriptive statistics\nDiscuss inclusion criteria.\nDiscuss how your sample relates to the “source population” (lecture 9.)\nExplain NZAVS measures. State the questions used in the items\nIn your own words describe how the data meet the following assumptions required for causal inference:\nPositivity: Can we intervene on the exposure at all levels of the covariates? Use the code I provided to test whether there is change in the exposure from the baseline in the source population(s)\nConsistency: Can I interpret what it means to intervene on the exposure?\nExchangeability: Are different versions of the exposure conditionally exchangeable given measured baseline confounders? This requires stating baseline confounders and explaining how they may be related to both the exposure and outcome. As part of this, you must explain why the baseline measure of your exposure and outcome are included as potential confounders.\nNote: Unmeasured Confounders: Does previous science suggest the presence of unmeasured confounders? (e.g. childhood exposures that are not measured).\nDraw a causal diagram: Have I drawn a causal diagram (DAG) to highlight both measured and unmeasured sources of confounding?\nMeasurement Error: Have I described potential biases from measurement errors? Return to lecture 11.\nState that you do not have missing data in this synthetic dataset, but that ordinarily missing data would need to be handled.\nState what your estimator will be. Note I’ve given you the following text to modify:\n\n\nThe Doubly Robust Estimation method for Subgroup Analysis Estimator is a sophisticated tool combining features of both IPTW and G-computation methods, providing unbiased estimates if either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. The process involves five main steps:\n\n\nStep 1 involves the estimation of the propensity score, a measure of the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates and the subgroup indicator. This score is calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, with the model choice depending on the nature of the data and exposure. Weights for each individual are then calculated using this propensity score. These weights depend on the exposure status and are computed differently for exposed and unexposed individuals. The estimation of propensity scores is performed separately within each subgroup stratum.\n\n\nStep 2 focuses on fitting a weighted outcome model, making use of the previously calculated weights from the propensity scores. This model estimates the outcome conditional on exposure, covariates, and subgroup, integrating the weights into the estimation process. Unlike in propensity score model estimation, covariates are included as variables in the outcome model. This inclusion makes the method doubly robust - providing a consistent effect estimate if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified, thereby reducing the assumption of correct model specification.\n\n\nStep 3 entails the simulation of potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup. These hypothetical scenarios assume universal exposure to the intervention within each subgroup, regardless of actual exposure levels. The expectation of potential outcomes is calculated for each individual in each subgroup, using individual-specific weights. These scenarios are performed for both the current and alternative interventions.\n\n\nStep 4 is the estimation of the average causal effect for each subgroup, achieved by comparing the computed expected values of potential outcomes under each intervention level. The difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure within each subgroup.\n\n\nStep 5 involves comparing differences in causal effects across groups by calculating the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups. Confidence intervals and standard errors for these calculations are determined using simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023). This step allows for a comprehensive comparison of the impact of different interventions across various subgroups, while encorporating uncertainty.\n\nAlso see the appendix here\n\nState what E-values are and how you will use them to clarify the risk of unmeasured confounding."

The script will generate these plots.\nWeighting Algorithm Statistics: Report the statistics for the weighting algorithms as provided by the WeightIt package, including any measures of balance or fit. The script I gave you will generate this information\n\n\nExample:\n\nWe estimated propensity scores by fitting a model for the exposure A as it is predicted by the set of baseline covariates defined by L. Because we are interested in effect modification by group, we fit different propensity score models for within strata of G using the subgroup command of the WeightIt package. Thus the propensity score is the the probability of receiving a value of a treatment (A=a) conditional on the covariates L, and stratum within G. We compared balance using the following methods of weighting: “ebal” or entropy balancing, “energy” or energy balancing, and “ps” or traditional inverse probability of weighting balancing. Of these methods “ebal” performed the best. Table X and Figure Y present the results of the ebalancing method.\n\n\nInterpretation of Propensity Scores: we interpret the proposensity scores as yeilding good balance across the exposure conditions.\nOutcome Regression Model: Clearly report the type of regression model used to estimate outcome model coefficients (e.g., linear regression, Poisson, binomial), and mention if the exposure was interacted with the baseline covariates. Do not report model coefficients as these have no interpretation. Example\n\n\nWe fit a linear model using maximum likelihood estimation with the outcome Y predicted by the exposure A. We interacted the exposure with all baseline confounders L. Continuous baseline confounders were converted to z-scores, whereas categorical exposures were not. Also interacted with all baseline confounders was a term for the subgroup interactoin. This allowed uas to flexibily fit non-linearities for the modification of the effect of the exposure within levels of the levels of the cultural group strata of interest. We note that model coefficients have no interpretation in this context so are not reported. The remaining steps of Doubly-Robust estimation were performed as outlined in the Method section. We calculated confidence intervals and standard errors, using the clarify package in R, which relies on simulation based inference for these quantities of interest (Greifer et al. 2023)\n\n\nReport the causal estimates.\n\nATE contrasts for groups in setting the exposure to for each group in setting level A = a and A = a*\ndifferences between groups in the magnitude of the effects.

Data wrangling is the majority of data analysis. The good news is that R makes wrangling relatively straightforward.\n\nmutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))): This creates a new column called id that has unique identification factors for each row in the dataset. It ranges from 1 to the number of rows in the dataset.\nThe next mutate operation is used to convert the t0_eth_cat, t0_urban, and t0_gen_cohort variables to factor type, if they are not already.\nThe filter command is used to subset the dataset to only include rows where the t0_eth_cat is either “euro” or “māori”. The original dataset includes data with four different ethnic categories. This command filters out any row not related to these two groups.\nungroup() ensures that there’s no grouping in the dataframe.\nThe mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) step standardizes all numeric columns in the dataset by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (a z-score transformation). The resulting columns are renamed to include “_z” at the end of their original names.\nThe select function is used to keep only specific columns: the id column, any columns that are factors, and any columns that end in “_z”.\nThe relocate functions re-order columns. The first relocate places the id column at the beginning. The next three relocate functions order the rest of the columns based on their names: those starting with “t0_” are placed before “t1_” columns, and those starting with “t2_” are placed after “t1_” columns.\ndroplevels() removes unused factor levels in the dataframe.\nFinally, skimr::skim(dt) will print out a summary of the data in the dt object using the skimr package. This provides a useful overview of the data, including data types and summary statistics.\n\nThis function seems to be part of a data preparation pipeline in a longitudinal or panel analysis, where observations are ordered over time (indicated by t0_, t1_, t2_, etc.).\n\n### ### ### ### ### ### SUBGROUP DATA ANALYSIS: DATA WRANGLING  ### ### ### ###\n\ndt &lt;- dt_prepare|&gt;\n  mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n  t0_eth_cat = as.factor(t0_eth_cat),\n  t0_urban = as.factor(t0_urban),\n  t0_gen_cohort = as.factor(t0_gen_cohort)\n) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(t0_eth_cat == \"euro\" |\n                t0_eth_cat == \"māori\") |&gt; # Too few asian and pacific\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  # transform numeric variables into z scores (improves estimation)\n  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) %&gt;%\n  # select only factors and numeric values that are z-scores\n  select(id, # category is too sparse\n         where(is.factor),\n         ends_with(\"_z\"), ) |&gt;\n  # tidy data frame so that the columns are ordered by time (useful for more complex models)\n  relocate(id, .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))   |&gt;\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t0_\"), .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))  |&gt;\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t2_\"), .after = starts_with(\"t1_\")) |&gt;\n  droplevels()\n\n\n# checks\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_depression_z)\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_anxiety_z)\n\ndt |&gt;\n  tabyl(t0_eth_cat, t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ) |&gt;\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n# Visualise missingness\nnaniar::vis_miss(dt)\n\n# save your dataframe for future use\n\n# make dataframe\ndt = as.data.frame(dt)\n\n# save data\nsaveRDS(dt, here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n\nCalculate propensity scores\nNext we generate propensity scores.\n\n# read  data -- you may start here if you need to repeat the analysis\ndt &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n# get column names\nbaseline_vars_reflective_propensity &lt;- dt|&gt;\n  dplyr::select(starts_with(\"t0\"), -t0_eth_cat) |&gt; colnames()\n\n# define our exposure\nX &lt;- \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen\"\n\n# define subclasses\nS &lt;- \"t0_eth_cat\"\n\n# Make sure data is in a data frame format\ndt &lt;- data.frame(dt)\n\n\n# next we use our trick for creating a formula string, which will reduce our work\nformula_str_prop &lt;-\n  paste(X,\n        \"~\",\n        paste(baseline_vars_reflective_propensity, collapse = \"+\"))\n\n# this shows the exposure variable as predicted by the baseline confounders.\nformula_str_prop\n\n[1] \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ~ t0_male+t0_gen_cohort+t0_urban+t0_hours_exercise_coarsen+t0_edu_z+t0_employed_z+t0_nz_dep2018_z+t0_nzsei13_z+t0_partner_z+t0_parent_z+t0_pol_orient_z+t0_agreeableness_z+t0_conscientiousness_z+t0_extraversion_z+t0_honesty_humility_z+t0_openness_z+t0_neuroticism_z+t0_modesty_z+t0_religion_identification_level_z+t0_hours_exercise_log_z+t0_kessler_latent_anxiety_z+t0_kessler_latent_depression_z\"\n\n\nFor propensity score analysis, we will try several different approaches.

Also energy will work with continuous exposures.\nFor more information, see https://ngreifer.github.io/WeightIt/\n\n# traditional propensity scores-- note we select the ATT and we have a subgroup \ndt_match_ps &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  method = \"ps\"\n)\n\nsaveRDS(dt_match_ps, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ps\"))\n\n\n# ebalance\ndt_match_ebal &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  method = \"ebal\"\n)\n\n# save output\nsaveRDS(dt_match_ebal, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ebal\"))\n\n\n\n## energy balance method\ndt_match_energy &lt;- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  #focal = \"high\", # for use with ATT\n  method = \"energy\"\n)\nsaveRDS(dt_match_energy, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy\"))\n\nResults, first for Europeans\n\n#dt_match_energy &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy\"))\ndt_match_ebal &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ebal\"))\n#dt_match_ps &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ps\"))\n\n# next we inspect balance. \"Max.Diff.Adj\" should ideally be less than .05, but less than .1 is ok.

Of these approaches, entropy balancing provided the best balance. The results indicate an excellent balance across all variables, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold of 0.05 across a range of binary and continuous baseline confounders, including gender, generation cohort, urban_location, exercise hours (coarsened, baseline), education, employment status, depression, anxiety, and various personality traits. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs.\n\n\nThe effective sample sizes were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 2880, 3927, and 1834, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 1855.89, 3659.59, and 1052.01, respectively.\n\n\nThe weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2310 to 7.0511) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.5769 to 1.9603). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n\nWe also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n\nWe plotted these results using love plots, visually confirming both the balance in the propensity score model using entropy balanced weights, and the imbalance in the model that does not adjust for baseline confounders.\n\n\nOverall, these findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, conditional on the measured covariates included in the model.\n\n\n\nExample Summary Maori Propensity scores.\nResults:\n\nThe entropy balancing method was also the best performing method that was applied to a subgroup analysis of the Māori population. Similar to the NZ European subgroup analysis, the method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup.\n\n\nThe effective sample sizes for the Māori subgroup were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 307, 354, and 160, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 220.54, 321.09, and 76.39, respectively\n\n\nThe weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups in the Māori subgroup varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2213 to 3.8101) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.3995 to 1.9800). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n\nThe study also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group for the Māori subgroup. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the results of the Māori subgroup analysis are consistent with the overall analysis. The entropy balancing method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold. These findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, even in subgroup analyses.\n\n\n\nMore data wrangling\nNote that we need to attach the weights from the propensity score model back to the data.\nHowever, because our weighting analysis estimates a model for the exposure, we only need to do this analysis once, no matter how many outcomes we investigate. So there’s a little good news.\n\n# prepare nz_euro data\ndt&lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\")) # original data subset only nz europeans\n\ndt_ref_e &lt;- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"euro\") # original data subset only nz europeans\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_e$weights &lt;- dt_match_ebal$euro$weights # get weights from the ps matching model,add to data\n\n# prepare maori data\ndt_ref_m &lt;- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"māori\")# original data subset only maori\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_m$weights &lt;- dt_match_ebal$māori$weights # get weights from the ps matching model, add to data\n\n# combine data into one data frame\ndt_ref_all &lt;- rbind(dt_ref_e, dt_ref_m) # combine the data into one dataframe. \n\n# save data for later use, if needed\nsaveRDS(dt_ref_all, here::here(\"data\",\"dt_ref_all\"))"

The associated confidence interval, ranging from -0.131 to -0.022, does not cross zero, providing more certainty in our estimate.\n\n\nE-values quantify the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounding variable would need to have with both the treatment and outcome, to fully explain away our observed effect. In this case, any unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both exercise and anxiety reduction, with a risk ratio of at least 1.352 to explain away the observed effect, and at least 1.167 to shift the confidence interval to include a null effect.\n\n\nTurning to the Māori group, the data suggest a possible reducing effect of exercise on anxiety, with a causal contrast value of 0.027. Yet, the confidence interval for this estimate (-0.114 to 0.188) also crosses zero, indicating similar uncertainties. An unmeasured confounder would need to have a risk ratio of at least 1.183 with both exercise and anxiety to account for our observed effect, and a risk ratio of at least 1 to render the confidence interval inclusive of a null effect.\n\n\nThus, while our analysis suggests that exercise could potentially reduce anxiety in both New Zealand Europeans and Māori, we advise caution in interpretation.

Hence, while the estimates suggest a potential effect of Exercise on Depression for the Māori Depression, the substantial uncertainty and possible influence of unmeasured confounders mean these findings should be interpreted with caution.\"      \n\n\n\n\nEstimate the subgroup contrast\n\n# calculated above\nest_all_d &lt;- readRDS( here::here(\"data\",\"est_all_d\"))\n\n# make the sumamry into a dataframe so we can make a table\ndfd &lt;- as.data.frame(summary(est_all_d))\n\n# get rownames for selecting the correct row\ndfd$RowName &lt;- row.names(dfd)\n\n# select the correct row -- the group contrast\nfiltered_dfd &lt;- dfd |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(RowName == \"RD_m - RD_e\") \n\n\n# Print the filtered data frame\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nfiltered_dfd  |&gt; \n  select(-RowName) |&gt; \n  kbl(digits = 3) |&gt; \n  kable_material(c(\"striped\", \"hover\")) \n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate\n2.5 %\n97.5 %\n\n\n\n\nRD_m - RD_e\n0.068\n-0.09\n0.229\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting might be:\n\nThe estimated reduction of depression from exercise is higher overall for New Zealand Europeans (RD_e) compared to Māori (RD_m). This is suggested by the estimated risk difference (RD_m - RD_e) of 0.068. However, there is a degree of uncertainty in this estimate, as the confidence interval (-0.09 to 0.229) crosses zero. This suggests that we cannot be confident that the difference in depression reduction between New Zealand Europeans and Māori is statistically significant. It’s possible that the true difference could be zero or even negative, implying a greater depression reduction for Māori than New Zealand Europeans. Thus, while the results hint at a larger depression reduction for New Zealand Europeans, the uncertainty in this estimate urges us to interpret this difference with caution.\n\n\n\nDiscusion\nYou’ll need to do this yourself. Here’s a start:\n\nIn our study, we employed a robust statistical method that helps us estimate the impact of exercise on reducing anxiety among different population groups – New Zealand Europeans and Māori. This method has the advantage of providing reliable results even if our underlying assumptions aren’t entirely accurate – a likely scenario given the complexity of real-world data. However, this robustness comes with a trade-off: it gives us wider ranges of uncertainty in our estimates. This doesn’t mean the analysis is flawed; rather, it accurately represents our level of certainty given the data we have.\n\n\nExercise and Anxiety\n\nOur analysis suggests that exercise may have a greater effect in reducing anxiety among New Zealand Europeans compared to Māori. This conclusion comes from our primary causal estimate, the risk difference, which is 0.104. However, it’s crucial to consider our uncertainty in this value. We represent this uncertainty as a range, also known as a confidence interval. In this case, the interval ranges from -0.042 to 0.279. What this means is, given our current data and method, the true effect could plausibly be anywhere within this range. While our best estimate shows a higher reduction in anxiety for New Zealand Europeans, the range of plausible values includes zero and even negative values. This implies that the true effect could be no difference between the two groups or even a higher reduction in Māori. Hence, while there’s an indication of a difference, we should interpret it cautiously given the wide range of uncertainty.\n\n\nThus, although our analysis points towards a potential difference in how exercise reduces anxiety among these groups, the level of uncertainty means we should be careful about drawing firm conclusions. More research is needed to further explore these patterns.\n\n\n\nExercise and Depression\n\nIn addition to anxiety, we also examined the effect of exercise on depression. We do not find evidence for reduction of depression from exercise in either group. We do not find evidence for the effect of weekly exercise – as self-reported – on depression.\n\n\n\nProviso\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that statistical results are only one piece of a larger scientific puzzle about the relationship between excercise and well-being. Other pieces include understanding the context, incorporating subject matter knowledge, and considering the implications of the findings. In the present study, wide confidence intervals suggest the possibility of considerable individual differences.\\dots nevertheless, \\dots\n\nAgain, you will need to come up with your own discussion, but follow the step-by-step instructions above as a guide."

What type of excercise? How regularly must one exercise? For how long must one exercise? Which ethnicities shall we compare? Why?\nIt helpst to think like an experimentalist… (say more)\nIn this exampe, we’ll do the following:\n\nCreate a Kessler 6 average score\nCreate a Kessler 6 sum score\nCreate a Kessler 6 binary score (Not Depressed vs. Moderately or Severely Depressed)\nCreate a log Exercise score\nCreate a coarsened Exercise score.\n\nConsider: the NZAVS asks participants the following question. During the past week, list “Hours spent exercising/physical activity.” The question is inherently unclear about what sort of physical activity someone is doing. When participants respond to this question, what do they mean? John considers anything that is not sleep to be physical activity. He returns a high number. Jane only counts aerobic exercise. For Jane, walking an hour to work and back doesn’t count.\nRecall that an assumption of causal inference is consistency.

It's often used when you don't have a specific hypothesis about what latent factors (unobservable variables) might be influencing the observed variables in your dataset.\n#\n# In this analysis, we've requested three factors (latent variables), and the table presents the loadings of each observed variable on each of these factors. The loadings can be interpreted as the correlations between the observed variables and the latent factors.\n#\n# Here's how to interpret the output:\n#\n#   The variables kessler_depressed, kessler_worthless, and kessler_hopeless load strongly on the first latent factor (MR1), and do not significantly load on the other two. This suggests that these three variables share some common underlying factor.\n#\n# The variable kessler_nervous loads exclusively on the second latent factor (MR2), suggesting it might represent a different latent construct.\n#\n# The variables kessler_restless and kessler_effort load on the third latent factor (MR3), which could represent yet another underlying construct.\n#\n# The \"Complexity\" column indicates the complexity of each item. Complexity 1 indicates that the item is influenced mostly by a single factor.\n#\n# The \"Uniqueness\" column represents the proportion of variance in each variable that is not explained by the factors. For example, the uniqueness of kessler_depressed is 0.33, which means that 33% of the variance in this variable is not accounted for by the three factors.\n#\n# Lastly, the total variance explained by the three latent factors is 66.05%, with MR1 explaining 35.14%, MR2 explaining 17.17%, and MR3 explaining 13.73%. This indicates that about two-thirds of the variance in the six observed variables can be explained by the three latent factors extracted in the analysis.\n# fa -- there is no agreed method!\n# method of agreement:\n\n\n\n\nCode\nn &lt;- n_factors(dt_only_k6)\n\n# # summary\n# as.data.frame(n)\n\n# plot of smmary\nplot(n) + theme_modern()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## CFA\n\n\nNext try a CFA\n\n\nCode\n# first partition the data \npart_data &lt;- datawizard::data_partition(dt_only_k6, traing_proportion = .07, seed = 123)\n\ntraining &lt;- part_data$p_0.7\ntest &lt;- part_data$test\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|label: cfa_all\n# one factor\nstructure_k6_one &lt;- psych::fa(training, nfactors = 1) |&gt;\n  efa_to_cfa()\n\n# two factor model\nstructure_k6_two &lt;- psych::fa(training, nfactors = 2) |&gt;\n  efa_to_cfa()\n\n# three structure model\nstructure_k6_three &lt;- psych::fa(training, nfactors = 3) %&gt;%\n  efa_to_cfa()\n\n# inspect models\nstructure_k6_one\n\n\n# Latent variables\nMR1 =~ kessler_depressed + kessler_effort + kessler_hopeless + kessler_worthless + kessler_nervous + kessler_restless + .row_id\n\n\nCode\nstructure_k6_two\n\n\n# Latent variables\nMR1 =~ kessler_depressed + kessler_hopeless + kessler_worthless\nMR2 =~ kessler_effort + kessler_nervous + kessler_restless + .row_id\n\n\nCode\nstructure_k6_three\n\n\n# Latent variables\nMR1 =~ kessler_depressed + kessler_effort + kessler_hopeless + kessler_worthless\nMR2 =~ kessler_restless\nMR3 =~ kessler_nervous + .row_id\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# fit and compare models\none_latent &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_one, data = test))\ntwo_latents &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_two, data = test))\nthree_latents &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_three, data = test))\n\ncompare &lt;- performance::compare_performance(one_latent, two_latents, three_latents, verbose = FALSE)\n\n# view as html table\nas.data.frame(compare)|&gt;\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nModel\nChi2\nChi2_df\np_Chi2\nBaseline\nBaseline_df\np_Baseline\nGFI\nAGFI\nNFI\nNNFI\nCFI\nRMSEA\nRMSEA_CI_low\nRMSEA_CI_high\np_RMSEA\nRMR\nSRMR\nRFI\nPNFI\nIFI\nRNI\nLoglikelihood\nAIC\nAIC_wt\nBIC\nBIC_wt\nBIC_adjusted\n\n\n\n\none_latent\nlavaan\n1359.7168\n14\n0\n159746.19\n21\n0\n0.9533955\n0.9067909\n0.9914883\n0.9873622\n0.9915748\n0.1033455\n0.0987385\n0.1080285\n0.0000000\n36.00334\n0.0493327\n0.9872324\n0.6609922\n0.9915752\n0.9915748\n-151483.7\n302995.3\n0\n303094.8\n0\n303050.3\n\n\ntwo_latents\nlavaan\n317.9709\n13\n0\n30915.75\n21\n0\n0.9900793\n0.9786322\n0.9897149\n0.9840541\n0.9901287\n0.0510548\n0.0462789\n0.0559908\n0.3499758\n36.31236\n0.0226983\n0.9833856\n0.6126807\n0.9901313\n0.9901287\n-150962.8\n301955.6\n1\n302062.2\n1\n302014.5\n\n\nthree_latents\nlavaan\n747.8723\n12\n0\n20903.30\n21\n0\n0.9763317\n0.9447739\n0.9642223\n0.9383317\n0.9647609\n0.0825447\n0.0775761\n0.0876237\n0.0000000\n37.13824\n0.0377955\n0.9373890\n0.5509842\n0.9647761\n0.9647609\n-151177.7\n302387.5\n0\n302501.2\n0\n302450.3\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table provides the results of three different Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) models: one that specifies a single latent factor, one that specifies two latent factors, and one that specifies three latent factors. The results include a number of goodness-of-fit statistics, which can be used to assess how well each model fits the data.\n\nOne_latent Model: This model assumes that there is only one underlying latent factor contributing to all variables. This model has a chi-square statistic of 1359.7 with 14 degrees of freedom, which is highly significant (p&lt;0.001), indicating a poor fit of the model to the data. Other goodness-of-fit indices like GFI, AGFI, NFI, NNFI, and CFI are all high (above 0.9), generally indicating good fit, but these indices can be misleading in the presence of large sample sizes. RMSEA is above 0.1 which indicates a poor fit. The SRMR is less than 0.08 which suggests a good fit, but given the high Chi-square and RMSEA values, we can’t solely rely on this index. The Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and adjusted BIC are used for comparing models, with lower values indicating better fit.\n\n\nTwo_latents Model: This model assumes that there are two underlying latent factors. The chi-square statistic is lower than the one-factor model (317.97 with 13 df), suggesting a better fit. The p-value is still less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significant chi-square, which typically suggests a poor fit. However, all other fit indices (GFI, AGFI, NFI, NNFI, and CFI) are above 0.9 and the RMSEA is 0.051, which generally indicate good fit. The SRMR is also less than 0.08 which suggests a good fit. This model has the lowest AIC and BIC values among the three models, indicating the best fit according to these criteria.\n\n\nThree_latents Model: This model assumes three underlying latent factors. The chi-square statistic is 747.87 with 12 df, higher than the two-factor model, suggesting a worse fit to the data. Other fit indices such as GFI, AGFI, NFI, NNFI, and CFI are below 0.97 and the RMSEA is 0.083, which generally indicate acceptable but not excellent fit. The SRMR is less than 0.08 which suggests a good fit. The AIC and BIC values are higher than the two-factor model but lower than the one-factor model, indicating a fit that is better than the one-factor model but worse than the two-factor model.\nBased on these results, the two-latents model seems to provide the best fit to the data among the three models, according to most of the fit indices and the AIC and BIC. Note, all models have significant chi-square statistics, which suggests some degree of misfit. It’s also important to consider the substantive interpretation of the factors, to make sure the model makes sense theoretically.\n\n\n\nTry with multiple groups\n\n\nCode\n# select the columns we need + ethnicity\ndt_eth_k6_eth &lt;- dt_start |&gt; \n  filter(eth_cat == \"euro\" | eth_cat == \"maori\") |&gt; \n  select(kessler_depressed, kessler_effort,kessler_hopeless,\n                                 kessler_worthless, kessler_nervous,\n                                 kessler_restless, eth_cat)\n\n\n\n# remove ethnicity for traning data \n\n\n\n\n# first partition the data \npart_data_eth &lt;- datawizard::data_partition(dt_eth_k6_eth, traing_proportion = .07, seed = 123, group = \"eth_cat\")\n\ntraining_eth &lt;- part_data_eth$p_0.7\ntest_eth &lt;- part_data_eth$test\n\n\n# fit and compare models for configural equivalence\none_latent_eth_configural &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_one, group = \"eth_cat\", data = test_eth))\ntwo_latents_eth_configural &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_two, group = \"eth_cat\", data = test_eth))\nthree_latents_eth_configural &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_three, group = \"eth_cat\", data = test_eth))\n\ncompare_eth_configural &lt;- performance::compare_performance(one_latent_eth_configural, two_latents_eth_configural, three_latents_eth_configural, verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n# fit and compare models for metric equivalence\none_latent_eth_metric &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_one, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal = \"loadings\", data = test_eth))\ntwo_latents_eth_metric  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_two, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal = \"loadings\", data = test_eth))\nthree_latents_eth_metric  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_three, group = \"eth_cat\",group.equal = \"loadings\", data = test_eth))\n\ncompare_eth_metric  &lt;- performance::compare_performance(one_latent_eth_metric, \n                                                        two_latents_eth_metric, \n                                                        three_latents_eth_metric, \n                                                        verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n# fit and compare models for scalar equivalence\none_latent_eth_scalar &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_one, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal = c(\"loadings\",\"intercepts\"), data = test_eth))\ntwo_latents_eth_scalar  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_two, group = \"eth_cat\", group.equal =  c(\"loadings\",\"intercepts\"), data = test_eth))\nthree_latents_eth_scalar  &lt;- suppressWarnings(lavaan::cfa(structure_k6_three, group = \"eth_cat\",group.equal =  c(\"loadings\",\"intercepts\"), data = test_eth))\n\ncompare_eth_scalar  &lt;- performance::compare_performance(one_latent_eth_scalar, \n                                                        two_latents_eth_scalar, \n                                                        three_latents_eth_scalar, \n                                                        verbose = FALSE)\n\n\nRecall, in the context of measurement and factor analysis, the concepts of configural, metric, and scalar invariance relate to the comparability of a measurement instrument, such as a survey or test, across different groups.\nWe saw in part 1 of this course that these invariance concepts are frequently tested in the context of cross-cultural, multi-group, or longitudinal studies.\nLet’s first define these concepts, and then apply them to the context of the Kessler 6 (K6) Distress Scale used among Maori and New Zealand Europeans.\n\nConfigural invariance refers to the most basic level of measurement invariance, and it is established when the same pattern of factor loadings and structure is observed across groups. This means that the underlying constructs (factors) are defined the same way for different groups. This doesn’t mean the strength of relationship between items and factors (loadings) or the item means (intercepts) are the same, just that the items relate to the same factors in all groups.\n\nIn the context of the K6 Distress Scale, configural invariance would suggest that the same six items are measuring the construct of psychological distress in the same way for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans, even though the strength of the relationship between the items and the construct (distress), or the average scores, might differ.\n\nMetric invariance (also known as “weak invariance”) refers to the assumption that factor loadings are equivalent across groups, meaning that the relationship or association between the measured items and their underlying factor is the same in all groups. This is important when comparing the strength of relationships with other variables across groups.\n\nIf metric invariance holds for the K6 Distress Scale, this would mean that a unit change in the latent distress factor would correspond to the same change in each item score (e.g., feeling nervous, hopeless, restless, etc.) for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans.\n\nScalar invariance (also known as “strong invariance”) involves equivalence of both factor loadings and intercepts (item means) across groups. This means that not only are the relationships between the items and the factors the same across groups (as with metric invariance), but also the zero-points or origins of the scales are the same. Scalar invariance is necessary when one wants to compare latent mean scores across groups.\n\nIn the context of the K6 Distress Scale, if scalar invariance holds, it would mean that a specific score on the scale would correspond to the same level of the underlying distress factor for both Māori and New Zealand Europeans. It would mean that the groups do not differ systematically in how they interpret and respond to the items. If this holds, one can make meaningful comparisons of distress level between Maori and New Zealand Europeans based on the scale scores.\nNote: each of these levels of invariance is a progressively stricter test of the equivalence of the measurement instrument across groups. Demonstrating scalar invariance, for example, also demonstrates configural and metric invariance. On the other hand, failure to demonstrate metric invariance means that scalar invariance also does not hold. These tests are therefore usually conducted in sequence. The results of these tests should be considered when comparing group means or examining the relationship between a scale and other variables across groups.\n\n\nConfigural invariance:\n\n\nCode\nas.data.frame(compare_eth_configural)|&gt;\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nModel\nChi2\nChi2_df\np_Chi2\nBaseline\nBaseline_df\np_Baseline\nGFI\nAGFI\nNFI\nNNFI\nCFI\nRMSEA\nRMSEA_CI_low\nRMSEA_CI_high\np_RMSEA\nRMR\nSRMR\nRFI\nPNFI\nIFI\nRNI\nLoglikelihood\nAIC\nAIC_wt\nBIC\nBIC_wt\nBIC_adjusted\n\n\n\n\none_latent_eth_configural\nlavaan\n1162.4746\n14\n0\n341229.17\n21\n0\n0.9831752\n0.9579381\n0.9965933\n0.9949511\n0.9966341\n0.1027048\n0.0977499\n0.1077479\n0.0000000\n38.29915\n0.0439380\n0.9948899\n0.6643955\n0.9966342\n0.9966341\n-129452.1\n258946.1\n0\n259092.3\n0\n259025.5\n\n\ntwo_latents_eth_configural\nlavaan\n276.7703\n13\n0\n42034.04\n21\n0\n0.9961916\n0.9897467\n0.9934156\n0.9898581\n0.9937217\n0.0510782\n0.0459383\n0.0564019\n0.3560216\n34.17489\n0.0201464\n0.9893636\n0.6149715\n0.9937229\n0.9937217\n-129009.2\n258062.4\n1\n258215.5\n1\n258145.6\n\n\nthree_latents_eth_configural\nlavaan\n701.6287\n12\n0\n27397.50\n21\n0\n0.9906044\n0.9725962\n0.9743908\n0.9559166\n0.9748095\n0.0859629\n0.0806184\n0.0914299\n0.0000000\n76.26852\n0.0358868\n0.9551839\n0.5567947\n0.9748177\n0.9748095\n-129221.6\n258489.3\n0\n258649.3\n0\n258576.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table represents the comparison of three multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models conducted to test for configural invariance across different ethnic categories (eth_cat). Configural invariance refers to whether the pattern of factor loadings is the same across groups. It’s the most basic form of measurement invariance.\nLooking at the results, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\nChi2 (Chi-square): A lower value suggests a better model fit. In this case, the two_latents_eth_configural model exhibits the lowest Chi2 value, suggesting it has the best fit according to this metric.\nGFI (Goodness of Fit Index) and AGFI (Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index): These values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 suggesting a better fit. The two_latents_eth_configural model has the highest GFI and AGFI values, indicating it is the best fit according to these indices.\nNFI (Normed Fit Index), NNFI (Non-Normed Fit Index, also called TLI), CFI (Comparative Fit Index): These range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 suggesting a better fit. The one_latent_eth_configural model has the highest values, suggesting it is the best fit according to these metrics.\nRMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation): Lower values are better, with values below 0.05 considered good and up to 0.08 considered acceptable. In this table, the two_latents_eth_configural model has an RMSEA of 0.05, which falls within the acceptable range.\nRMR (Root Mean Square Residual) and SRMR (Standardized Root Mean Square Residual): Lower values are better, typically less than 0.08 is considered a good fit. All models exhibit acceptable RMR and SRMR values, with the two_latents_eth_configural model having the lowest.\nRFI (Relative Fit Index), PNFI (Parsimonious Normed Fit Index), IFI (Incremental Fit Index), RNI (Relative Noncentrality Index): These range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 suggesting a better fit. The one_latent_eth_configural model has the highest values, suggesting the best fit according to these measures.\nAIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion): Lower values indicate a better fit when comparing models. The two_latents_eth_configural model has the lowest AIC and BIC, suggesting it is the best fit according to these criteria.\np_Chi2 and p_RMSEA: These are the significance levels for the Chi-square test and the RMSEA, respectively. Non-significant values (p &gt; 0.05) suggest a good fit. Only the RMSEA for the two_latents_eth_configural model is non-significant, suggesting a good fit.\n\nOverall, the two_latents_eth_configural model appears to provide the best fit across multiple indices, suggesting configural invariance (i.e., the same general factor structure) across ethnic categories with a two-factor solution. As with the previous assessment, theoretical soundness and other substantive considerations should also be taken into account when deciding on the final model.\n\n\nMetric Equivalence\n\n\nCode\nas.data.frame(compare_eth_metric)|&gt;\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nModel\nChi2\nChi2_df\np_Chi2\nBaseline\nBaseline_df\np_Baseline\nGFI\nAGFI\nNFI\nNNFI\nCFI\nRMSEA\nRMSEA_CI_low\nRMSEA_CI_high\np_RMSEA\nRMR\nSRMR\nRFI\nPNFI\nIFI\nRNI\nLoglikelihood\nAIC\nAIC_wt\nBIC\nBIC_wt\nBIC_adjusted\n\n\n\n\none_latent_eth_metric\nlavaan\n1162.4746\n14\n0\n341229.17\n21\n0\n0.9831752\n0.9579381\n0.9965933\n0.9949511\n0.9966341\n0.1027048\n0.0977499\n0.1077479\n0.0000000\n38.29915\n0.0439380\n0.9948899\n0.6643955\n0.9966342\n0.9966341\n-129452.1\n258946.1\n0\n259092.3\n0\n259025.5\n\n\ntwo_latents_eth_metric\nlavaan\n276.7703\n13\n0\n42034.04\n21\n0\n0.9961916\n0.9897467\n0.9934156\n0.9898581\n0.9937217\n0.0510782\n0.0459383\n0.0564019\n0.3560216\n34.17489\n0.0201464\n0.9893636\n0.6149715\n0.9937229\n0.9937217\n-129009.2\n258062.4\n1\n258215.5\n1\n258145.6\n\n\nthree_latents_eth_metric\nlavaan\n701.6287\n12\n0\n27397.50\n21\n0\n0.9906044\n0.9725962\n0.9743908\n0.9559166\n0.9748095\n0.0859629\n0.0806184\n0.0914299\n0.0000000\n76.26852\n0.0358868\n0.9551839\n0.5567947\n0.9748177\n0.9748095\n-129221.6\n258489.3\n0\n258649.3\n0\n258576.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table presents the results of a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) conducted to test metric equivalence (also known as measurement invariance) across different ethnic categories (eth_cat).

It ranges from 1 to the number of rows in the dataset.\nThe next mutate operation is used to convert the t0_eth_cat, t0_urban, and t0_gen_cohort variables to factor type, if they are not already.\nThe filter command is used to subset the dataset to only include rows where the t0_eth_cat is either “euro” or “māori”. The original dataset includes data with four different ethnic categories. This command filters out any row not related to these two groups.\nungroup() ensures that there’s no grouping in the dataframe.\nThe mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) step standardizes all numeric columns in the dataset by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (a z-score transformation). The resulting columns are renamed to include “_z” at the end of their original names.\nThe select function is used to keep only specific columns: the id column, any columns that are factors, and any columns that end in “_z”.\nThe relocate functions re-order columns. The first relocate places the id column at the beginning. The next three relocate functions order the rest of the columns based on their names: those starting with “t0_” are placed before “t1_” columns, and those starting with “t2_” are placed after “t1_” columns.\ndroplevels() removes unused factor levels in the dataframe.\nFinally, skimr::skim(dt) will print out a summary of the data in the dt object using the skimr package. This provides a useful overview of the data, including data types and summary statistics.\n\nThis function seems to be part of a data preparation pipeline in a longitudinal or panel analysis, where observations are ordered over time (indicated by t0_, t1_, t2_, etc.).\n\n\nCode\n### ### ### ### ### ### SUBGROUP DATA ANALYSIS: DATA WRANGLING  ### ### ### ###\n\ndt &lt;- dt_prepare|&gt;\n  mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n  t0_eth_cat = as.factor(t0_eth_cat),\n  t0_urban = as.factor(t0_urban),\n  t0_gen_cohort = as.factor(t0_gen_cohort)\n) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(t0_eth_cat == \"euro\" |\n                t0_eth_cat == \"māori\") |&gt;

For the Māori group (`_m`):\n#\n#   - `E[Y(inactive)]_m`: When inactive, the expected level of depression is 0.23 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.116 to 0.356.\n# - `E[Y(active)]_m`: When active, the expected level of depression decreases to 0.193 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.108 to 0.282.\n# - `E[Y(very_active)]_m`: When very active, the expected level of depression further decreases to 0.133 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.009 to 0.262.\n# - `RD_m`: The risk difference (RD) between inactive and very active Māori individuals is 0.097 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from -0.068 to 0.274. This indicates a decrease in depression when individuals move from an inactive to a very active lifestyle.\n#\n# 2. For the NZ European group (`_e`):\n#\n#   - `E[Y(inactive)]_e`: When inactive, the expected level of depression is 0.034 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from -0.012 to 0.078.\n# - `E[Y(active)]_e`: When active, the expected level of depression slightly decreases to -0.006 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from -0.03 to 0.016.\n# - `E[Y(very_active)]_e`: When very active, the expected level of depression further decreases to -0.046 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from -0.086 to -0.007.\n# - `RD_e`: The risk difference (RD) between inactive and very active NZ European individuals is 0.081 standard deviations, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.02 to 0.138. Similar to the Māori group, this indicates a decrease in depression when individuals move from an inactive to a very active lifestyle.\n#\n# The last row, `RD_m - RD_e`, represents the difference in risk differences between Māori and NZ Europeans. It's 0.017 standard deviations with a 95% confidence interval from -0.152 to 0.204. This is not statistically significant (the confidence interval contains 0), suggesting that the difference in depression reduction from being inactive to very active is not significantly different between the two groups.\n#\n# These are estimates and subject to statistical uncertainty.

    "text": "Installing RStudio\nAfter downloading R…\nSee Johannes Karl’s Video\n\nStep 1: Install R-Studio\nIf you have already downloaded and installed R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN):\n\nGo to the RStudio download page at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\nChoose the free version of RStudio Desktop, and download it for your operating system.\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop.\nOpen RStudio to begin setting up your project environment.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create a new project\n\nIn RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project.\nChoose New Directory for a new project or Existing Directory if you have a folder where you want to initialise an RStudio project.\nFor a new project, select New Project, then provide a directory name. This name will also be the name of your project.\nSpecify the location where the project folder will be created.\nClick Create Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder your R-studio/R workflow\n\n\n\n\nClear folder structure\nIf you are using GitHub (or similar) create a location on your machine (i.d. not dropbox)\nIf you are not using GitHub choose the cloud (Dropbox or similar).\nWhen creating new files and scripts, use clear labels that anyone could understand.\nThat “anyone” will be your future self, trying to make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Give project structure\n\nOrganising Files and Folders:\n\nWithin your project, create folders to organise your scripts and data.\nCommon folder names include R/ for R scripts, data/ for datasets, and doc/ for documentation.\nYou can create these folders using RStudio’s Files pane or through your operating system’s file explorer.\n\nCreating and Managing R Scripts:\n\nTo create a new R script, go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nSave the script in your project directory’s R/ folder to keep your work organised. Use meaningful file names that describe the script’s purpose.\n\nVersion Control:\n\nIf you are familiar with version control, you can initialise a Git repository within your project by selecting the Version Control option when creating a new project.\nThis allows for better tracking of changes and collaboration if working with others.\nIf you are not familiar with version control (or have not installed git on your machine), do not worry about initialising a Git repository.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Working with R-scripts\n\nWriting and executing Code:\n\nWrite your R code in the script editor.\nExecute code by selecting lines and pressing Ctrl + Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Enter (Mac).\n\nCommenting and documentation:\n\nUse comments (preceded by #) to document your code for clarity and future reference.\n\nSaving and organising scripts:\n\nRegularly save your scripts (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S).\nOrganise scripts into folders within your project for different analyses or data processing tasks.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: When you exit R-studio\n\nBefore concluding your work, save your workspace or clear it to start fresh in the next session (Session &gt; Restart R).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder your R-studio/R workflow\n\n\n\n\nAgain, use clearly defined script names\nAnnotate your code\nSave your scripts often (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Install the tidyverse package\n\n\n\nFollow these instructions to install the tidyverse package in RStudio:\n\nOpen RStudio: launch RStudio on your computer.\nAccess package installation:\n\nNavigate to the menu at the top of RStudio and click on Tools &gt; Install Packages.... This opens the Install Packages dialogue box.\n\nInstall tidyverse:\n\nIn the Install Packages dialogue box, you will see a field labelled “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):”. Click in this field and type tidyverse.\nBelow the packages field, ensure the checkbox for Install dependencies is checked. This ensures all packages that tidyverse depends on are also installed.\n\nBegin installation:\n\nClick on the Install button to start the installation process.\n\n\nThe installation might take a few minutes. Monitor the progress in the “Console” pane. Once the installation is complete, you will see a message in the console indicating that the process has finished.\n\nLoad tidyverse: After successful installation, you can load the tidyverse package into your R session by typing library(tidyverse) in the console and pressing Enter."

Here is how you can incorporate these operations into your basic R commands documentation:\n\n\nMultiplication (*) and Division (/)\nMultiplication and division in R are performed using the * and / operators, respectively. These operators allow for element-wise operations on vectors, as well as operations on individual numeric values.\n\n# multiplication\nproduct &lt;- x * y # multiplies x by y\nproduct\n\n[1] 50\n\n# division\nquotient &lt;- x / y # divides x by y\nquotient\n\n[1] 2\n\n# element-wise multiplication on vectors\nvector1 &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nvector2 &lt;- c(4, 5, 6)\n# multiplies each element of vector1 by the corresponding element of vector2\nvector_product &lt;- vector1 * vector2\nvector_product\n\n[1]  4 10 18\n\n# element-wise division on vectors\n# divides each element of vector1 by the corresponding element of vector2\nvector_division &lt;- vector1 / vector2\nvector_division\n\n[1] 0.25 0.40 0.50\n\n\n\nMultiplication and division can be used for scalar (single values) and vector (multiple values) operations. When applied to vectors, these operations are performed element-wise.\nBe mindful of division by zero, as this will result in Inf (infinity) or NaN (not a number) depending on the context.\n\n\n# example of division by zero\nresult &lt;- 10 / 0 # results in Inf\nzero_division &lt;- 0 / 0 # results in NaN\n\n\nR also supports integer division using the %/% operator and modulo operation using %% to find the remainder.\n\n\n# integer division\ninteger_division &lt;- 10 %/% 3 # results in 3\n\n# modulo operation\nremainder &lt;- 10 %% 3 # results in 1\n\n\n\nrm() Remove Object\n\n# `rm()` remove object ----------------------------------------------------\ndevil_number &lt;- 666 # results in 1\n\n# view\ndevil_number\n\n[1] 666\n\n# remove the devil number\nrm(devil_number)\n\n# check\n# devil_number\n\n\n\nLogic (!, !=, ==)\nLogical operations include NOT (!), NOT EQUAL (!=), and EQUAL (==).\n\nx_not_y &lt;- x != y # checks if x is not equal to y\nx_not_y\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nx_equal_10 &lt;- x == 10 # checks if x is equal to 10\nx_equal_10\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nLogical operations are fundamental in R for controlling the flow of execution and making decisions based on conditions. In addition to NOT (!), NOT EQUAL (!=), and EQUAL (==), there are several other logical operators you should know:\n\n\nOR (| and ||)\n\nThe | operator performs element-wise logical OR operation. It evaluates each pair of elements in two logical vectors to see if at least one is TRUE.\nThe || operator performs a logical OR operation but only evaluates the first element of each vector – mainly used in if statements and not for vectorised operations.\n\n\n# element-wise OR\nvector_or &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE) | c(FALSE, TRUE) # returns c(TRUE, TRUE)\nvector_or\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE\n\n# single OR (only looks at first element)\nsingle_or &lt;- TRUE || FALSE # returns TRUE\nsingle_or\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\nAND (& and &&)\n\nThe & operator performs element-wise logical AND operations. It checks if both elements in the corresponding positions of two logical vectors are TRUE.\nThe && operator performs a logical AND operation but only evaluates the first element of each vector. Like ||, used in conditions that do not require vectorised operations.\n\n\n# element-wise AND\nvector_and &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE) & c(FALSE, TRUE) # returns c(FALSE, FALSE)\n\n# single AND (only looks at first element)\nsingle_and &lt;- TRUE && FALSE # returns FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Workflow Shortcuts\n\n\n\nShortcuts bring order and boost creativity\n\nExecute Code Line: Cmd + Return (Mac) or Ctrl + Enter (Windows/Linux)\nInsert Section Heading: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)\nAlign Code: Cmd + Shift + A (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + A (Windows/Linux)\nComment/Uncomment: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + C\nSave All: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S\nFind/Replace: Cmd/Ctrl + F, Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F\nNew File: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N\nAuto-complete: Tab\n\nFor more commands, explore the Command Palette available under Tools -&gt; Command Palette or Shift + Cmd + P (Mac) or Shift + Ctrl + P (Windows/Linux)."

    "section": "Simulating Data in R",
    "text": "Simulating Data in R\nSimulating data is a powerful method to understand statistical concepts and data manipulation. Let’s simulate a simple dataset representing scores from two cultural groups.\n\nStep 1: Setting Up Your R Environment\nBefore simulating data, ensure R or RStudio is installed and open. RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for R, which can simplify the process of writing and executing R scripts.\n\n\nStep 2: Setting a Seed for Reproducibility\nTo ensure that your simulated data can be reproduced exactly, it’s good practice to set a seed before generating random data. This makes your analyses and simulations replicable.\nset.seed(123) # use any number to set the seed\n\n\nStep 3: Simulating Continuous Data\nTo simulate continuous data, you can use functions like rnorm() for normal distributions, runif() for uniform distributions, etc. Here’s how to simulate 100 normally distributed data points with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10:\n\nn &lt;- 100 # number of observations\nmean &lt;- 50\nsd &lt;- 10\ndata_continuous &lt;- rnorm(n, mean, sd)\n\n\n\nStep 4: Simulating Categorical Data\nCategorical data can be simulated using the sample() function. For example, to simulate a binary variable (e.g., gender) with two levels for 100 observations:\n\nlevels &lt;- c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\ndata_categorical &lt;- sample(levels, n, replace = TRUE)\n\n\n\nStep 5: Simulating Data Frames\nData frames are used in R to store data tables. To simulate a dataset with both continuous and categorical data, you can combine the above steps:\n\n# create a data frame with simulated data for ID, Gender, Age, and Income\ndata_frame &lt;- data.frame(\n  # generate a sequence of IDs from 1 to n\n  ID = 1:n,\n  \n  # randomly assign 'Male' or 'Female' to each observation\n  Gender = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  \n  # simulate 'Age' data: normally distributed with mean 30 and sd 5\n  Age = rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 5),\n  \n  # simulate 'Income' data: normally distributed with mean 50000 and sd 10000\n  Income = rnorm(n, mean = 50000, sd = 10000)\n)\n\nNote that you can sample probabilistically for your groups\n\nn &lt;- 100 # total number of observations\n\n# sample 'Gender' with a 40/60 proportion for Male/Female\nGender = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.6))\n\n\n\nStep 6: Add Complexity\nTo simulate more complex datasets, you can introduce relationships between variables. For instance, simulating age and income with a correlation:\n\n# set the number of observations\nn &lt;- 100\n\n# simulate the 'Age' variable\nmean_age &lt;- 30\nsd_age &lt;- 5\nAge &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = mean_age, sd = sd_age)\n\n# define coefficients explicitly\nintercept &lt;- 20000   # Intercept for the income equation\nbeta_age &lt;- 1500     # Coefficient for the effect of age on income\nerror_sd &lt;- 10000    # Standard deviation of the error term\n\n# simulate 'Income' based on 'Age' and defined coefficients\nIncome &lt;- intercept + beta_age * Age + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = error_sd)\n\n# create a data frame to hold the simulated data\ndata_complex &lt;- data.frame(Age, Income)\n\n\n\nStep 7: Visualising Simulated Data\nVisualising your simulated data can help understand its distribution and relationships. Use the ggplot2 package for this:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data_complex, aes(x = Age, y = Income)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Simulated Age vs. Income\", x = \"Age\", y = \"Income\")"

    "text": "Upshot\nANOVA partitions variance into between-group and within-group components, while regression models the mean of the dependent variable as a linear function of the independent (including categorical) variables. For many questions, ANOVA is appropriate, however, when we are comparing groups, we often want a finer-grained interpretation. Regression is built for obtaining this finer grain understanding. We will return to regression over the next few weeks and use regression to hone your skills in R. Later, Along the way, you’ll learn more about data visualisation, modelling, and reporting.\n\n# graph the output of the parameters table\n# visualisation\nplot(table_fit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nPerform a linear regression analysis using R. Follow the detailed instructions below to simulate the necessary data, execute the regression, and report your findings:\n\nSimulate Data:\n\nGenerate two continuous variables, Y and A, with n = 100 observations each.\nThe variable A should have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (sd) of 10.\n\nDefine the Relationship:\n\nSimulate the variable Y such that it is linearly related to A with a specified effect size. The effect size of A on Y must be explicitly defined as 2.\n\nIncorporate an Error Term:\n\nWhen simulating Y, include an error term with a standard deviation (sd) of 20 to introduce variability.\n\nRegression Analysis:\n\nUse the lm() function in R to regress Y on A.\nEnsure the regression model captures the specified effect of A on Y.\n\nReport the Results:\n\nOutput the regression model summary to examine the coefficients, including the effect of A on Y, and assess the model’s overall fit and significance.\n\n\nHere’s a template to get you started\n\nlibrary(parameters)\n#  seed for reproducibility\nset.seed( ) # numbers go in brackets\n\n# number of observations\nn &lt;-   # number goes here\n\n# simulate data for variable A with specified mean and sd\nA &lt;- rnorm(n, \n           mean = , # set your number here \n           sd = )# set your number here \n\n# define the specified effect size of A on Y\nbeta_A &lt;-   # define your effect with a number here \n\n\n# simulate data and make data frame in one step\n\ndf_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  # simulate data for variable A with specified mean and sd\n  A = A, # from above\n  Y = 5 + beta_A * A + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 20) #  effect is intercept + ...\n)\n\n# view\nhead(df_3)\nstr(df_3)\n\n#  linear regression of Y on A\nfit_3 &lt;- lm(Y ~ A, data = df_3)\n\n#  results (standard code)\n# summary(model)\n\n# time saving reports\nparameters::model_parameters(fit_3)\nreport(fit_3)"

Here’s an example:\n\n# Creating a simple list\nmy_list &lt;- list(name = \"John Doe\", age = 30, scores = c(90, 80, 70))\n\n# A list containing various types of elements, including another list\ncomplex_list &lt;- list(id = 1, name = \"Jane Doe\", preferences = list(color = \"blue\", hobby = \"reading\"))\n\n\n\nAccessing List Elements\nList elements can be accessed using the [[ ]] notation for single elements, or the $ notation if you’re accessing named elements:\n\n# Accessing elements\nname &lt;- my_list$name  # or my_list[[\"name\"]]\npreference_color &lt;- complex_list$preferences$color\n\n\n\nModifying Lists\nLists can be modified by adding new elements, changing existing elements, or removing elements:\n\n# Adding a new element\nmy_list$gender &lt;- \"Male\"\n\n# Changing an existing element\nmy_list$age &lt;- 31\n\n# Removing an element\nmy_list$scores &lt;- NULL\n\n\n\nLists in Functions\nLists are often used as return values for functions that need to provide multiple pieces of data:\n\n# Function returning a list\ncalculate_stats &lt;- function(numbers) {\n  mean_val &lt;- mean(numbers)\n  sum_val &lt;- sum(numbers)\n  return(list(mean = mean_val, sum = sum_val))\n}\n\n# Using the function\nresults &lt;- calculate_stats(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n\n\n\nWhy Lists are Important\n\nFlexibility: lists can contain different types of elements, including other lists, data frames, and functions.\nFunction outputs: many R functions return lists because they can hold multiple types of outputs.\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Basic Operations and Data Structure Manipulation\n\n# Create vectors\nvector_a &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8)\nvector_b &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7)\n\n# Operations\nsum_vector &lt;- vector_a + vector_b\ndiff_vector &lt;- vector_a - vector_b\ndouble_vector_a &lt;- vector_a * 2\nhalf_vector_b &lt;- vector_b / 2\n\n# Mean and Standard Deviation\nmean_a &lt;- mean(vector_a)\nsd_a &lt;- sd(vector_a)\nmean_b &lt;- mean(vector_b)\nsd_b &lt;- sd(vector_b)\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Working with Data Frames\n\n# Create data frame\nstudent_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  ID = 1:4,\n  Name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Diana\"),\n  Score = c(88, 92, 85, 95),\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\n# Add Passed column\nstudent_data$Passed &lt;- student_data$Score &gt;= 90\n\n# Subset students who passed\npassed_students &lt;- student_data[student_data$Passed == TRUE, ]\n\n# Explore data frame\nsummary(student_data)\n\n       ID           Name               Score         Passed       \n Min.   :1.00   Length:4           Min.   :85.00   Mode :logical  \n 1st Qu.:1.75   Class :character   1st Qu.:87.25   FALSE:2        \n Median :2.50   Mode  :character   Median :90.00   TRUE :2        \n Mean   :2.50                      Mean   :90.00                  \n 3rd Qu.:3.25                      3rd Qu.:92.75                  \n Max.   :4.00                      Max.   :95.00                  \n\nhead(student_data)\n\n  ID    Name Score Passed\n1  1   Alice    88  FALSE\n2  2     Bob    92   TRUE\n3  3 Charlie    85  FALSE\n4  4   Diana    95   TRUE\n\nstr(student_data)\n\n'data.frame':   4 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ ID    : int  1 2 3 4\n $ Name  : chr  \"Alice\" \"Bob\" \"Charlie\" \"Diana\"\n $ Score : num  88 92 85 95\n $ Passed: logi  FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Logical Operations and Subsetting\n\n# Subset data based on score\nmean_score &lt;- mean(student_data$Score)\nstudents_above_mean &lt;- student_data[student_data$Score &gt; mean_score, ]\n\n# Add attendance and subset\nattendance &lt;- c(\"Present\", \"Absent\", \"Present\", \"Present\")\nstudent_data$Attendance &lt;- attendance\npresent_students &lt;- student_data[student_data$Attendance == \"Present\", ]\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Cross-Tabulation and Analysis\n\n# Create factor variables\nFruit &lt;- factor(c(\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Banana\"))\nColor &lt;- factor(c(\"Red\", \"Yellow\", \"Green\", \"Orange\", \"Green\"))\n\n# Create data frame\nfruit_data &lt;- data.frame(Fruit, Color)\n\n# Cross-tabulation\nfruit_color_table &lt;- table(fruit_data$Fruit, fruit_data$Color)\nprint(fruit_color_table)\n\n        \n         Green Orange Red Yellow\n  Apple      1      0   1      0\n  Banana     1      0   0      1\n  Orange     0      1   0      0\n\n# Interpretation: Apple has the most color variety with 2 colors (Red, Green).\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Visualization with ggplot2\n\n# Install and load ggplot2\nif (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create bar plot\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = Name, y = Score, fill = Passed)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"blue\", \"FALSE\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Student Scores\", x = \"Name\", y = \"Score\") +\n  theme_minimal()"

    "text": "Simulating Data in R: Outcome ~ Treatment\n\nStep 1: Set Up Your R Environment\nEnsure R or RStudio is installed and open.\n\n\nStep 2: Set a Seed for Reproducibility\nTo ensure that your simulated data can be reproduced exactly. Again, it is good practice to set a seed before generating random data. This makes your analyses and simulations replicable.\n\nset.seed(123) # use any number to set the seed\n\n\n\nStep 3: Simulate Continuous Data: One Variable\nTo simulate continuous data, you can use functions like rnorm() for normal distributions, runif() for uniform distributions, etc. Here we simulate 100 normally distributed data points with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10:\n\nn &lt;- 100 # number of observations\nmean &lt;- 50\nsd &lt;- 10\ndata_continuous &lt;- rnorm(n, mean, sd)\n\n# view\nhead(data_continuous)\n\n[1] 44.39524 47.69823 65.58708 50.70508 51.29288 67.15065\n\n# view using base R histogram\nhist(data_continuous)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Simulate Categorical Data\nCategorical data can be simulated using the sample() function. Here, we simulate a binary variable (gender) with two levels for 100 observations. There is equal probability of assignment.\n\nlevels &lt;- c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\ndata_categorical &lt;- sample(levels, n, replace = TRUE)\n\n# view\nhead(data_categorical)\n\n[1] \"Female\" \"Female\" \"Female\" \"Male\"   \"Female\" \"Female\"\n\n# check\ntable(data_categorical)\n\ndata_categorical\nFemale   Male \n    49     51 \n\n\nTo generate categories with unequal probabilities, you can use the sample() function by specifying the prob parameter, which defines the probability of selecting each level. This allows for simulating categorical data where the distribution between categories is not uniform.\nBelow is an example that modifies your initial code to create a categorical variable with unequal probabilities for “Male” and “Female”. Here is an example with unequal probabilities:\n\n# define levels and number of observations\nlevels &lt;- c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\nn &lt;- 100 # total number of observations\n\n# generate categorical data with unequal probabilities\ndata_categorical_unequal &lt;- sample(levels, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7))\n\n# view the first few elements\n# head(data_categorical_unequal)\n\n# check\ntable(data_categorical_unequal)\n\ndata_categorical_unequal\nFemale   Male \n    69     31"

Regression analysis estimates the mean of the dependent variable as a linear function of the independent (including categorical) variables. For many questions, ANOVA is appropriate, however, when comparing groups, we often want a finer-grained interpretation. Regression is built for obtaining this finer grain comparisons. Note: comparisons do not establish causality. We will return to regression over the next few weeks and use regression to hone your skills in R. Later, along the way, you’ll learn more about data visualisation, modelling, and reporting. These skills are essential for your final report.

    "text": "Summary\nCongratulations on completing Lab 1! This session has laid the groundwork. We’ve covered a lot, but we’ll have a good deal of practice throughout the course.\n\nWhat We Have Learned\n\nHow to install and setup R:\n\nYou’ve successfully installed R and RStudio, setting up your workstation for statistical analysis.\n\nHow to install and use RStudio:\n\nYou’ve familiarised yourself with the RStudio interface, including the console, source editor, environment tab, and other utilities for effective data analysis.\n\nBasic R operations:\n\nYou’ve practided using R for basic arithmetic operations, understanding how to execute simple commands in the console.\n\nBasic R Data Structures such as:\n\nVectors and Matrices: You have learned to create and manipulate vectors and matrices, the simplest forms of data storage in R, which are crucial for handling numeric, character, and logical data types in a structured manner.\nData Frames: You’ve been introduced to data frames, a key data structure in R for storing tabular data. Data frames accommodate columns of different data types, making them highly versatile for data analysis and manipulation.\nFactors and Ordered Factors: Understanding factors and ordered factors has provided you with the tools to handle categorical data effectively, including the ability to manage and analyse data involving categorical variables with both unordered and ordered levels.\n\nBasics of ggplot2:\n\nYou’ve been equipped with the fundamentals of data visualisation using ggplot2, including how to create basic plots like bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs. You’ve learned about the importance of aesthetics (aes) and geometries (geom_ functions) in creating visually appealing and informative graphics.\n\nCustomizing Plots:\n\nTechniques for enhancing plots with titles, axis labels, and custom colour schemes have been covered. You’ve practised making your visualisations more informative and engaging by customising plot aesthetics.\n\n\nHow to Build Skills?\n\nPractical Application:\n\nDo the hands-on exercises at home. They’ll help you apply what you have learned here.\n\n\nWhere to Get Help\nAs sure as night follows day, you will need help coding. Good resources:\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs): OpenAI’s premium LLM (GPT-4) outperforms the free version (GPT-3.5) for complex queries. I don’t think LLM’s are quite ready for science, but they are remarkably helpful for coding, and for learning how to code. So please use them, with caution, but use them.\nStack Overflow: a valuable resource for coding advice and solutions.\nCross-validated is probably the best place to go for stats advice. (LLMs are currently not reliable for statisticis for which there is not much information – which is most of science.)\nDeveloper Websites and GitHub Pages: Directly engage with package developers and the community for insights and support.Parameters package discussion page offers insights and support directly from its developers and user community.\nYour tutors and lecturer. We care. We’re here to help you!\n\n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nWickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for Data Science. O’Reilly Media. [Available online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz\nA helpful resource for learning R is Megan Hall’s lecture available at: https://meghan.rbind.io/talk/neair/.\nRStudio has compiled numerous accessible materials for learning R, which can be found here: https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/.\nMaterials from a previous course on learning R can be accessed here. https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-447/ For now, only lecture 1 would be relevant. It’s worth noting that this lecture covers working with GitHub. GitHub is a useful tool, you should learn how to use it; however, it is not a requirement for the current course.\n\n\n\nPackages\n\nreport::cite_packages()\n\n  - Chang W (2023). _extrafont: Tools for Using Fonts_.

    "text": "First Data Visualisation with ggplot2\nggplot2 is a powerful and flexible R package for creating elegant data visualisations. It is based on the Grammar of Graphics, allowing users to build plots layer by layer, making it versatile for creating a wide range of plots.\n\nInstalling and Loading ggplot2\nBefore using ggplot2, ensure the package is installed and loaded into your R session:\n\n# load ggplot2\nif (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# simulate student data (more on simulation next week)\nstudent_data &lt;- data.frame(\n    name = c(\"alice\", \"bob\", \"charlie\", \"diana\", \"ethan\", \"fiona\", \"george\", \"hannah\"),\n    score = sample(80:100, 8, replace = TRUE), # random scores between 80 and 100\n    stringsasfactors = FALSE\n)\n\n# determine pass/fail based on score\n# we will cover the ifelse() operator in detail in upcoming weeks\nstudent_data$passed &lt;- ifelse(student_data$score &gt;= 90, \"passed\", \"failed\")\n\n# convert 'passed' to factor for colour coding in ggplot2\nstudent_data$passed &lt;- factor(student_data$passed, levels = c(\"failed\", \"passed\"))\n\n# view the first few rows of the data frame\nhead(student_data)\n\n     name score stringsasfactors passed\n1   alice    93            FALSE passed\n2     bob    98            FALSE passed\n3 charlie    95            FALSE passed\n4   diana    90            FALSE passed\n5   ethan    81            FALSE failed\n6   fiona    90            FALSE passed\n\n# simulate study hours\nstudent_data$study_hours &lt;- sample(5:15, 8, replace = TRUE)\n\n\n\nBasic Components of a ggplot2 Plot\n\nData: the dataset you want to visualise.\nAesthetics (aes): defines how data are mapped to colour, size, shape, and other visual properties.\nGeometries (geom_ functions): the type of plot or layer you want to add (e.g., points, lines, bars).\n\n\nCreate a Basic Plot\nStart by creating a simple bar plot:\n\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = name, y = score)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code plots score for each name in the student_data dataframe. The stat = \"identity\" argument tells ggplot2 to use the score values directly to determine the height of the bars.\n\n\nCustomising the plot\nTo enhance your plot, you can add titles, change axis labels, and modify colours:\n\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = name, y = score, fill = passed)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"true\" = \"blue\", \"FALSE\" = \"red\")) +\n    labs(title = \"student scores\", x = \"student name\", y = \"score\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naes(fill = passed): maps the passed variable to the colour fill of the bars, allowing for colour differentiation based on whether students passed or failed.\nscale_fill_manual(): customizes the colours used for the true and FALSE values of the passed variable.\nlabs(): adds a main title and axis labels.\ntheme_minimal(): applies a minimalistic theme to the plot for a cleaner appearance.\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plot with ggplot2\nA scatter plot is useful for examining the relationship between two continuous variables.\nWe next simulate a scenario where we compare student scores against study hours.\n\n# create scatter plot\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = study_hours, y = score, color = passed)) +\n    geom_point(size = 4) +\n    labs(title = \"student scores vs. study hours\", x = \"study hours\", y = \"score\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"failed\" = \"red\", \"passed\" = \"blue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox Plot with ggplot2\nBox plots are excellent for visualising the distribution of scores by pass/fail status, showing medians, quartiles, and potential outliers.\n\n# create box plot\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = passed, y = score, fill = passed)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(title = \"score distribution by pass/fail status\", x = \"status\", y = \"score\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"failed\" = \"red\", \"passed\" = \"blue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram with ggplot2\nHistograms are helpful for understanding the distribution of a single continuous variable, such as scores.\n\n# create a histogram\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = score, fill = passed)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n    labs(title = \"histogram of scores\", x = \"score\", y = \"count\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"failed\" = \"red\", \"passed\" = \"blue\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot with ggplot2 (Time Series)\nFor demonstrating a line plot, we simulate monthly study hours over a semester for a student.\n\n# simulate monthly study hours\nmonths &lt;- factor(month.abb[1:8], levels = month.abb[1:8])\nstudy_hours &lt;- c(0, 3, 15, 30, 35, 120, 18, 15)\n\n# make data frame\nstudy_data &lt;- data.frame(month = months, study_hours = study_hours)\n\n# create a line plot\nggplot(study_data, aes(x = month, y = study_hours, group = 1)) +\n    geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = \"blue\") +\n    geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n    labs(title = \"monthly study hours\", x = \"month\", y = \"study hours\") +\n    theme_minimal()"

The pch parameter specifies the symbol type, and col changes the colour based on whether the student passed or failed.\n\n\nGenerating a Histogram with Base R\nTo visualise the distribution of student scores:\n\n# histogram with Base R\nhist(student_data$score,\n    breaks = 5,\n    col = \"skyblue\",\n    main = \"Histogram of Student Scores\",\n    xlab = \"Scores\",\n    border = \"white\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram provides a quick overview of the scores’ distribution, using the hist function with specified breaks, col for colour, and border for the colour of the histogram borders.\n\n\nGenerate Line Plot with Base R\n\n# must be numeric\nmonths_num &lt;- 1:length(study_data$month) # Simple numeric sequence\n\n# plot points with suppressed x-axis\nplot(months_num, study_data$study_hours,\n    type = \"p\", # Points\n    pch = 19, # Type of point\n    col = \"red\",\n    xlab = \"Month\",\n    ylab = \"Study Hours\",\n    main = \"Monthly Study Hours\",\n    xaxt = \"n\"\n) # Suppress the x-axis\n\n# add lines between points\nlines(months_num, study_data$study_hours,\n    col = \"blue\",\n    lwd = 1\n) # Line width\n\n# add custom month labels to the x-axis at appropriate positions\naxis(1, at = months_num, labels = study_data$month, las = 2) # `las=2` makes labels perpendicular to axis\n\n# Optional: adding a box around the plot for a minimalistic look\nbox()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Distributions with Box Plots\nBox plots in Base R can compare the score distributions across the pass/fail status:\n\n# Box plot with Base R\nboxplot(score ~ passed,\n    data = student_data,\n    main = \"Score Distribution by Pass/Fail Status\",\n    xlab = \"Status\", ylab = \"Scores\",\n    col = c(\"red\", \"blue\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code uses the boxplot function to create box plots for scores, grouped by the pass/fail status, with custom colours for each group."

    "text": "Lab Summary\nCongratulations on completing Lab 1!\nThis session has laid the groundwork. We’ve covered a lot, but we’ll have a good deal of practice throughout the course.\n\nWhat We Have Learned\n\nHow to install and setup R:\n\nYou’ve successfully installed R and RStudio, setting up your workstation for statistical analysis.\n\nHow to install and use RStudio:\n\nYou’ve familiarised yourself with the RStudio interface, including the console, source editor, environment tab, and other utilities for effective data analysis.\n\nBasic R operations:\n\nYou’ve practided using R for basic arithmetic operations, understanding how to execute simple commands in the console.\n\nBasic R Data Structures such as:\n\nVectors and Matrices: You have learned to create and manipulate vectors and matrices, the simplest forms of data storage in R, which are crucial for handling numeric, character, and logical data types in a structured manner.\nData Frames: You’ve been introduced to data frames, a key data structure in R for storing tabular data. Data frames accommodate columns of different data types, making them highly versatile for data analysis and manipulation.\nFactors and Ordered Factors: Understanding factors and ordered factors has provided you with the tools to handle categorical data effectively, including the ability to manage and analyse data involving categorical variables with both unordered and ordered levels.\n\nBasics of ggplot2:\n\nYou’ve been equipped with the fundamentals of data visualisation using ggplot2, including how to create basic plots like bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs. You’ve learned about the importance of aesthetics (aes) and geometries (geom_ functions) in creating visually appealing and informative graphics.\n\nCustomizing Plots:\n\nTechniques for enhancing plots with titles, axis labels, and custom colour schemes have been covered. You’ve practised making your visualisations more informative and engaging by customising plot aesthetics.\n\n\nHow to Build Skills?\n\nPractical Application:\n\nDo the hands-on exercises at home. They’ll help you apply what you have learned here.\n\n\nWhere to Get Help\nAs sure as night follows day, you will need help coding. Good resources:\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs): OpenAI’s premium LLM (GPT-4) outperforms the free version (GPT-3.5) for complex queries. I don’t think LLM’s are quite ready for science, but they are remarkably helpful for coding, and for learning how to code. So please use them, with caution, but use them.\nStack Overflow: a valuable resource for coding advice and solutions.\nCross-validated is probably the best place to go for stats advice. (LLMs are currently not reliable for statisticis for which there is not much information – which is most of science.)\nDeveloper Websites and GitHub Pages: Directly engage with package developers and the community for insights and support.Parameters package discussion page offers insights and support directly from its developers and user community.\nYour tutors and lecturer. We care. We’re here to help you!\n\n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nWickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for Data Science. O’Reilly Media. [Available online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz\nA helpful resource for learning R is Megan Hall’s lecture available at: https://meghan.rbind.io/talk/neair/.\nRStudio has compiled numerous accessible materials for learning R, which can be found here: https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/.\nMaterials from a previous course on learning R can be accessed here. https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-447/ For now, only lecture 1 would be relevant. It’s worth noting that this lecture covers working with GitHub. GitHub is a useful tool, you should learn how to use it; however, it is not a requirement for the current course.\n\n\n\nPackages\n\nreport::cite_packages()\n\n  - Chang W (2023). _extrafont: Tools for Using Fonts_.

    "section": "Data Types in R",
    "text": "Data Types in R\nUnderstanding data types in R is essential. R supports several fundamental data types, including integers, characters, factors, and ordered factors. Each type has its specific use case and functions associated with it.\n\nIntegers\nIntegers are whole numbers without decimal points. In R, integers can be explicitly defined by adding an L suffix to the number.\n\n# define an integer\nx &lt;- 42L\n\nx\n\n[1] 42\n\n# check\nstr(x) # is integer\n\n int 42\n\n# convert to numeric\ny &lt;- as.numeric(x)\n\nstr(y)\n\n num 42\n\n\nIntegers are particularly useful when dealing with counts or indices that do not require fractional values.\n\n\nCharacters\nCharacter data types are used to represent text. In R, text strings are enclosed in quotes, either single (') or double (\").\n\n# define a character string\nname &lt;- \"Alice\"\n\nCharacters are essential for categorical data that does not fit into numerical categories, such as names, labels, and descriptions.\n\n\nFactors\nFactors are used to represent categorical data that can take on a limited number of values, known as levels. Factors are useful for statistical modeling as they explicitly define categories in the data.\n\n# Define a factor\ncolors &lt;- factor(c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"))\n\nFactors can improve efficiency and memory usage when dealing with categorical data, especially in large datasets. And they are useful when dealing with categorical variables (naturally).\n\nOrdered Factors\nOrdered factors are a special type of factor where the levels have an inherent order. They are defined similarly to factors but with an additional argument to denote the order.\n\n# ordered factors ---------------------------------------------------------\n# factors ordinary\neducation_levels &lt;- c(\"high school\", \"bachelor\", \"master\", \"ph.d.\")\neducation_factor_no_order &lt;- factor(education_levels, ordered = FALSE)\nstr(education_factor_no_order)\n\n Factor w/ 4 levels \"bachelor\",\"high school\",..: 2 1 3 4\n\n# factors with inherent order\neducation_factor &lt;- factor(education_levels, ordered = TRUE)\neducation_factor\n\n[1] high school bachelor    master      ph.d.      \nLevels: bachelor &lt; high school &lt; master &lt; ph.d.\n\n# another way to do the same\neducation_ordered_explicit &lt;- factor(education_levels, levels = education_levels, ordered = TRUE)\n\nOrdered factors allow for logical comparisons based on their order, which is particularly useful in analyses where the order of categories matters, such as ordinal regression.\n\n\nOperations with Ordered Factors\nOrdered factors support logical comparisons that consider the order of the levels.\n\n# comparison of ordered factors\nedu1 &lt;- ordered(\"bachelor\", levels = education_levels)\nedu2 &lt;- ordered(\"master\", levels = education_levels)\nedu2 &gt; edu1 # logical comparison\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# modifying ordered factors\nnew_levels &lt;- c(\"primary school\", \"high school\", \"bachelor\", \"master\", \"ph.d.\")\neducation_updated &lt;- factor(education_levels, levels = new_levels, ordered = TRUE)\nstr(education_updated)\n\n Ord.factor w/ 5 levels \"primary school\"&lt;..: 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\nChecking Data with Ordered Factors\nYou can view the structure and summary of ordered factors just as with regular factors, but the output will indicate the order.\n\n# view the structure\nstr(education_ordered_explicit)\n\n Ord.factor w/ 4 levels \"high school\"&lt;..: 1 2 3 4\n\n# summary to see the distribution\nsummary(education_ordered_explicit)\n\nhigh school    bachelor      master       ph.d. \n          1           1           1           1 \n\n\n\n\nModifying Ordered Factors\nIf you need to change the order of levels or add new levels, you can re-factor the variable using factor() or ordered() and specify the new levels.\n\n# modifying ordered factors\nnew_levels &lt;- c(\"primary school\", \"high school\", \"bachelor\", \"master\", \"ph.d.\")\neducation_updated &lt;- factor(education_levels, levels = new_levels, ordered = TRUE)\nstr(education_updated)\n\n Ord.factor w/ 5 levels \"primary school\"&lt;..: 2 3 4 5\n\nstr(education_updated)\n\n Ord.factor w/ 5 levels \"primary school\"&lt;..: 2 3 4 5"

    "section": "Data Frames",
    "text": "Data Frames\n\nCreate Data Frames\nData frames can be created using the data.frame() function, specifying each column and its values. Here’s a simple example:\n\n# clear any previous `df` object\nrm(df)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n    name = c(\"alice\", \"bob\", \"charlie\"),\n    age = c(25, 30, 35),\n    gender = c(\"female\", \"male\", \"male\")\n)\n# check structure\nhead(df)\n\n     name age gender\n1   alice  25 female\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n\nstr(df)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ name  : chr  \"alice\" \"bob\" \"charlie\"\n $ age   : num  25 30 35\n $ gender: chr  \"female\" \"male\" \"male\"\n\ntable(df$gender)\n\n\nfemale   male \n     1      2 \n\ntable(df$age)\n\n\n25 30 35 \n 1  1  1 \n\ntable(df$name)\n\n\n  alice     bob charlie \n      1       1       1 \n\n\nIn this example, df is a data frame with three columns (name, age, gender) and three rows, each representing a different individual.\n\n\nAccess Data Frame Elements\nThere are often several ways to do the same thing in R. You can access the elements of a data frame in several ways:\n\nBy column name: use the $ operator followed by the column name.\n\n\nnames &lt;- df$name # extracts the `name` column\nnames\n\n[1] \"alice\"   \"bob\"     \"charlie\"\n\n\n\nBy row and column: Use the [row, column] indexing. Rows or columns can be specified by number or name.\n\n\n# access data frame elements\nnames &lt;- df$name\nnames\n\n[1] \"alice\"   \"bob\"     \"charlie\"\n\nsecond_person &lt;- df[2, ]\nsecond_person\n\n  name age gender\n2  bob  30   male\n\nage_column &lt;- df[, \"age\"]\nage_column\n\n[1] 25 30 35\n\n\n\nUsing subset() Function: To extract subsets of the data frame based on conditions.\n\n\n# use subset()\nvery_old_people &lt;- subset(df, age &gt; 25) # extracts rows where `age` is greater than 18\nvery_old_people\n\n     name age gender\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n\nsummary(very_old_people$age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  30.00   31.25   32.50   32.50   33.75   35.00 \n\nmean(very_old_people$age)\n\n[1] 32.5\n\nmin(very_old_people$age)\n\n[1] 30\n\n\n\n\nExplore Your Data Frames\nFunctions such as head(), tail(), and str() help you explore the first few rows, last few rows, and the structure of the data frame, respectively.\n\nhead(df) # first six rows\n\n     name age gender\n1   alice  25 female\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n\ntail(df) # last six rows\n\n     name age gender\n1   alice  25 female\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n\nstr(df) # structure of the data frame\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ name  : chr  \"alice\" \"bob\" \"charlie\"\n $ age   : num  25 30 35\n $ gender: chr  \"female\" \"male\" \"male\"\n\n\n\n\nManipulating Data Frames\nData frames can be manipulated in various ways:\n\nAdding Columns: You can add new columns using the $ operator.\n\n\n# adds a new column \"employed\"\ndf$employed &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\n# show\nhead(df)\n\n     name age gender employed\n1   alice  25 female     TRUE\n2     bob  30   male     TRUE\n3 charlie  35   male    FALSE\n\n\n\nAdding rows: Use the rbind() function to add new rows.\n\n\nnew_person &lt;- data.frame(name = \"diana\", age = 28, gender = \"female\", employed = TRUE)\ndf &lt;- rbind(df, new_person)\n\n# show\nhead(df)\n\n     name age gender employed\n1   alice  25 female     TRUE\n2     bob  30   male     TRUE\n3 charlie  35   male    FALSE\n4   diana  28 female     TRUE\n\n\n\nModifying values: Access the element or column and assign it a new value.\n\n\n# note brackets\n# changes diana's age to 26\ndf[4, \"age\"] &lt;- 26\n\n# view row\ndf[4, ]\n\n   name age gender employed\n4 diana  26 female     TRUE\n\n\n\nRemoving columns or rows: set columns to NULL to remove them, or use - with row or column indices.\n\n\nhead(df)\n\n     name age gender employed\n1   alice  25 female     TRUE\n2     bob  30   male     TRUE\n3 charlie  35   male    FALSE\n4   diana  26 female     TRUE\n\n# remove employed column\ndf$employed &lt;- NULL\n\n# check\ndf\n\n     name age gender\n1   alice  25 female\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n4   diana  26 female\n\n# remove fourth row (Diana)\ndf &lt;- df[-4, ] # removes the fourth row\n\n# show\ndf\n\n     name age gender\n1   alice  25 female\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n\n\n\n\nAdd Rows with rbind()\nThe rbind() function in R stands for “row bind”. It is used to combine data frames or matrices by rows. This function is particularly useful when you want to add new observations or records to an existing data frame.\n\n#  adding a new row\nnew_person &lt;- data.frame(name = \"eve\", age = 32, gender = \"female\")\ndf &lt;- rbind(df, new_person)\n\n# verify the row addition\nhead(df)\n\n     name age gender\n1   alice  25 female\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n4     eve  32 female\n\n\nWhen using rbind(), ensure that the columns in the data frames being combined match in both name and order. If they do not match, you may encounter errors or unexpected results.\n\n\nAdding Columns with cbind()\nConversely, the cbind() function in R stands for “column bind”. It is used to combine data frames or matrices by columns. This function allows you to add new variables to an existing data frame.\n\n# example of adding a new column\ndf$occupation &lt;- c(\"engineer\", \"doctor\", \"artist\", \"doctor\") # direct assignment\n\n# or using cbind for a separate vector\noccupation_vector &lt;- c(\"engineer\", \"doctor\", \"artist\", \"doctor\")\ndf &lt;- cbind(df, occupation_vector)\n\n# verify the column addition\nhead(df)\n\n     name age gender occupation occupation_vector\n1   alice  25 female   engineer          engineer\n2     bob  30   male     doctor            doctor\n3 charlie  35   male     artist            artist\n4     eve  32 female     doctor            doctor\n\n\nAs with rbind(), when using cbind(), it is crucial that the data frames or vectors being combined have compatible dimensions. For cbind(), the number of rows must match.\n\n\nConsiderations for rbind() and cbind()\nWhile rbind() and cbind() are straightforward and powerful functions for combining data, they have some limitations:\n\nMatching Column or Row Names: for rbind(), the column names between the data frames need to match exactly. For cbind(), the row numbers must be equal.\nFactor Levels: when binding factors with different levels, R will unify the levels, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results. Be mindful of factor levels when using these functions.\nPerformance: we will use a different approach next week (and following), draing on thedplyr package, which will connect more easily to our workflows.\n\nBy understanding and utilizing rbind() and cbind(), you can efficiently manipulate the structure of your data frames, adding flexibility to your data analysis workflows in R.\n\n\nView Data Structure (summary(), str(), head(), tail())\n\nsummary(): Provides a summary of an object’s structure.\nstr(): Displays the structure of an object.\nhead(): Shows the first few rows of a data frame or the first elements of a vector.\ntail(): Shows the last few rows of a data frame or the last elements of a vector.\n\n\n# iris is a preloaded dataset\nstr(iris) # displays structure of scores_df\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\nsummary(iris) # summary statistics\n\n  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   \n Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  \n 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  \n Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  \n Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  \n 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  \n Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  \n       Species  \n setosa    :50  \n versicolor:50  \n virginica :50  \n                \n                \n                \n\nhead(iris) # first few rows\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\ntail(iris) # last few rows\n\n    Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width   Species\n145          6.7         3.3          5.7         2.5 virginica\n146          6.7         3.0          5.2         2.3 virginica\n147          6.3         2.5          5.0         1.9 virginica\n148          6.5         3.0          5.2         2.0 virginica\n149          6.2         3.4          5.4         2.3 virginica\n150          5.9         3.0          5.1         1.8 virginica\n\n\n\n\nmean()\n\nCalculates the arithmetic mean of a numerical object.\n\n\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# we will cover R’s powerful simulation functions like `rnorm()`next week\nvector &lt;- rnorm(n = 40, mean = 0, sd = 1)\nmean(vector) # note the sampling error here\n\n[1] 0.2401853\n\n\n\n\nsd()\n\nComputes the standard deviation, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.\n\n\nsd(vector) # replace 'vector' with your numerical vector\n\n[1] 1.038425\n\n\n\n\nmin() and max()\n\nThese functions return a numerical object’s minimum and maximum values, respectively.\n\n\nmin(vector) # minimum value\n\n[1] -1.817956\n\nmax(vector) # maximum value\n\n[1] 2.196834\n\n\n\n\ntable()\n\nGenerates a frequency table of an object, useful for categorical data.

You’ve practised making your visualisations more informative and engaging by customising plot aesthetics.\n\n\nHow to Build Skills?\n\nPractical Application:\n\nDo the hands-on exercises at home. They’ll help you apply what you have learned here.\n\n\nWhere to Get Help\nAs sure as night follows day, you will need help coding. Good resources:\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs): LLMs are trained on extensive datasets. They are extremely good coding tutors. Open AI’s GPT-4 considerably outperforms GPT-3.5. However GPT 3.5 should be good enough. Gemini has a two-month free trial. LLM’s are rapidly evolving. However, presently, to use these tools, and to spot their errors, you will need to know how to code. Which is fortunate because coding makes you smarter!\n\nNote: you will not be assessed for R-code. Help from LLM’s for coding does not consitute a breach of academic integrity in this course. Your tests are in-class; no LLM’s allowed. For your final report, you will need to cite all sources, and how you used them, including LLMs.\n\nStack Overflow:: an outstanding resource for most problems. Great community.\nCross-validated the best place to go for stats advice. (LLM’s are only safe for standard statistics. They do not perform well for causal inference.)\nDeveloper Websites and GitHub Pages: Tidyverse\nYour tutors and course coordinator. We care. We’re here to help you!\n\n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nWickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for Data Science. O’Reilly Media.

This is because causality occurs in time.\nImportance: we cannot interpret the associations we recover if they do not have a causal interpretation.\nChallenges: internal validity requires balance in the confounders that might afffect the treatement and outcome, and observational data do not give us ballance.\nThe Special Challenges in Cross-Cultural Research:\n\nThe concept of measurement itself has causal underpinnings (VanderWeele 2022).\nIn cross-cultural research, we have stronger challengs from measurement validity, which, as we shall see, encompasses both external and internal validity.\nWe consider measurment validity within classical framework of external and internal validity\nEthical challenges, which science needs to consider.\nForemost among these ethical challenges, I believe, is doing our best to get inference right!"

    "text": "Review\n\nPsychological research begins with two questions:\n\n\n\nWhat do I want to know?\nFor which population does this knowledge generalise?\n\n\nThis course considers how to ask this psychological questions that pertain to populations with different characteristics\n\nIn psychological research, we typically ask questions about the causes and consequences of thought and behaviour - “What if?” questions (Hernan and Robins 2024).\nThe following concepts help us to describe two distinct failure modes in psychological research when asking “What if?” questions:\n\n\nThe Concept of External Validity: the extent to which the findings of a study can be generalised to other situations, people, settings, and time periods. That is, we want to know if our findings carry beyond the sample population to the target population. We fail when our results do not generalise as we think. More fundamental, we fail when we have not clearly defined our question or our target population.\nThe Concept of Internal Validity: the extent to which the associations we obtain from data reflect causality. In psychological science, we use the terms “independent variable” and “dependent variable.” Sometimes we use the terms “exogenous variable” and “endogenous variable.” Sometimes we use the term “predictor variable” to describe the “dependent” or “endogenous” variable. These words are confusing. When asking “What if?” questions, we want to understand what would happen were we to intervene. In this course, we will use the term “treatment” or equivalently the term “exposure” to denote the intervention; we will use the term “outcome” to denote the effect of an intervention.1\n\n\nDefinition 1 We say internal validity is compromised if the association between the treatment and outcome in a study does not consistently reflect causality in the sample population as it is defined at baseline.\n\n\nDefinition 2 We say external validity is compromised if the association between the treatment and outcome in a study does not consistently reflect causality in the target population as it is defined at baseline.\n\n\nDuring the first part of the course, our primary focus will be on challenges to internal validity from confounding bias.\n\nThe concept of “confounding bias” helps to clarify what it is at stake when evaluating the internal validity of a study. As we shall see, there are several equivalent definitions of “confounding bias.” The definition that we will examine today is:\n\nDefinition 3 We say there is confounding-bias if there is an open back-door path between the treatment and outcome, or if that path between the treatment and outcome is blocked.\n\nOur purpose will be to clarify the meaning of the terminology in this definition, and along the way, to clarify how five elementary graphical structures and four rules allow us to determine whether and how to obtain internal validity from causal assumptions encoded in a causal diagram."

    "section": "Introduction to Causal Diagrams.",
    "text": "Introduction to Causal Diagrams.\nCausal diagrams, also called causal graphs, Directed Acyclic Graphs, and Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs, are graphical tools whose primary purpose is to enable investigators to detect confounding biases.\nRemarkably, causal diagrams are rarely used in psychology!\nBefore describing how causal diagrams work, we first define the meanings of their symbols. Note there is no single convention for creating causal diagrams, so it is important that we are clear when defining our meanings.\n\nThe meaning of our symbols\nThe conventions that describe the meanings of our symbols are given in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Our variable naming conventions. This figure is adapted from (Bulbulia 2023)\n\nBulbulia, J. A. 2023. “Causal Diagrams (Directed Acyclic Graphs): A Practical Guide.”\n\n\n\nFor us:\nX denotes a variable without reference to its role;\nA denotes the “treatment” or “exposure” variable. This is the variable for which we seek to understand the effect of intervening on it. It is the “cause;”\nY denotes the outcome or response of an intervention. It is the “effect.” Last week we considered whether marriage A causes happiness Y.\nY(a) denotes the counterfactual or potential state of Y in response to setting the level of the exposure to a specific level, A=a. As we will consider in the second half of the course, to consistently estimate causal effects we will need to evaluate counterfactual or potential states of the world. Keeping to our example, we will need to do more than evaluate marriage and happiness in people over time. We will need to evaluate how happy the unmarried people would have been had they been married and how happy the married people would have been had they not been married. Of course, these events cannot be directly observed. Thus to address fundamental questions in psychology, we need to contrast counterfactual states of the world. This might seem like science fiction; however, we are already familiar with methods for obtaining such counterfactual contrasts – namely, randomised controlled experiments! We will return to this concept later, but for now, it will be useful for you to understand the notation.\nL denotes a measured confounder or set of confounders is defined as a variable which, if conditioned upon, closes an open back-door path between the treatment A and the outcome Y. Consider the scenario where happiness at time 0 (L) affects both the probability of getting married at time 1 (A) and one’s happiness at time 2 (Y). In this case, L serves as a confounder because it influences both the treatment (marriage at time 1) and the outcome (happiness at time 2), potentially opening a back-door path that confounds the estimated effect of marriage on happiness.\nTo accurately estimate the causal effect of marriage on happiness, then, it is essential to control for L. With cross-sectional data, such control might be difficult.\nU denotes an unmeasured confounder – that is a variable that may affect both the treatment and the outcome, but for which we have no direct measurement. Suppose cultural upbringing affects both whether someone gets married and whether they are happy. If this variable is not measured, we cannot accurately estimate a causal effect of marriage on happiness.\nM denotes a mediator or a variable along the path from exposure to outcome. For example, perhaps marriage causes wealth and wealth causes happiness. As we shall see, conditioning on “wealth” when estimating the effect of marriage on happiness will make it seem that marriage does not cause happiness when it does, through wealth.\n\\bar{X} denotes a sequence of variables, for example, a sequence of treatments. Imagine we were interested in the causal effect of marriage and remarriage on well-being. In this case, there are two treatments A_0 and A_1 and four potential contrasts. For the scenario of marriage and remarriage affecting well-being, we denote the potential outcomes as Y(a_0, a_1), where a_0 and a_1 represent the specific values taken by A_0 and A_1, respectively. Given two treatments, A_0 and A_1, four primary contrasts of interest correspond to the different combinations of these treatments. These contrasts allow us to compare the causal effects of being married versus not and remarried versus not on well-being. The potential outcomes under these conditions can be specified as follows:\n\nY(0, 0): The potential outcome when there is no marriage.\nY(0, 1): The potential outcome when there is marriage.\nY(1, 0): The potential outcome when there is divorce.\nY(1, 1): The potential outcome from marriage prevalence.\n\nEach of these outcomes allows for a specific contrast to be made, comparing the well-being under different scenarios of marriage and remarriage. Which do we want to contrast? Note, the question about ‘the causal effects of marriage on happiness’ is ambiguous because we have not stated the causal contrast we are interested in.\n\\mathcal{R} denotes a randomisation or a chance event.\n\n\nElements of our Causal Graphs\nThe conventions that describe components of our causal graphs are given in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Nodes, Edges, Conditioning Conventions. This figure is adapted from (Bulbulia 2023)\n\nBulbulia, J. A. 2023. “Causal Diagrams (Directed Acyclic Graphs): A Practical Guide.”\n\n\n\n\nTime indexing\nIn our causal diagrams, we will implement two conventions to accurately depict the temporal order of events.\nFirst, the layout of a causal diagram will be structured from left to right to reflect the sequence of causality as it unfolds in reality. This orientation is crucial because causal diagrams must inherently be acyclic and because causality itself is inherently temporal.\nSecond, we will enhance the representation of the event sequence within our diagrams by systematically indexing our nodes according to the relative timing of events. If an event represented by X_0 precedes another event represented by X_1, the indexing will indicate this chronological order.\n\n\nRepresenting uncertainty in timing explicitly\nIn settings in which the sequence of events is ambiguous or cannot be definitively known, particularly in the context of cross-sectional data where all measurements are taken at a single point in time, we adopt a specific convention to express causality under uncertainty: X_{\\phi t}. This notation allows us to propose a temporal order without clear, time-specific measurements, acknowledging our speculation.\nFor instance, when the timing between events is unclear, we denote an event that is presumed to occur first as X_{\\phi 0} and a subsequent event as X_{\\phi 1}, indicating a tentative ordering where X_{\\phi 0} is thought to precede X_{\\phi 1}. However, it is essential to underscore that this notation signals our uncertainty regarding the actual timing of events; our measurements do not give us the confidence to assert this sequence definitively.\n\n\nArrows\nAs indicated in Figure 2, black arrows denote causality, red arrows reveal an open backdoor path, dashed black arrows denote attenuation, and red dashed arrows denote bias in a true causal association between A and Y. Finally, a blue arrow with a circle point denotes effect-measure modification, also known as “effect modification.” We might be interested in treatment effect heterogeneity without evaluating the causality in the sources of this heterogeneity. For example, we cannot typically imagine any intervention in which people could be randomised into cultures. However, we may be interested in whether the effects of an intervention that might be manipulable, such as marriage, differ by culture. To clarify this interest, we require a non-causal arrow.\n\\mathcal{R}\\to A denotes a random treatment assignment.\n\n\nBoxes\nWe use a black box to denote conditioning that reduces confounding or that is inert.\nWe use a red box to describe settings in which conditioning on a variable introduces confounding bias.\nOccasionally we will use a dashed circle do denote a latent variable, that is, a variable that is either not measured or not conditioned upon.\n\n\nTerminology for Conditional Independence\nThe bottom panel of Figure 2 shows some mathematical notation. Do not be alarmed, we are safe! Part 1 of the course will not require more complicated math than this notation. And we shall see that the notation is a compact way to describe intuitions that can be expressed less compactly in words:\n\nStatistical Independence (\\coprod): in the context of causal inference, statistical independence between the treatment and potential outcomes, denoted as A \\coprod Y(a), means the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes. This assumption is critical for estimating causal effects without bias.\nStatistical Dependence (\\cancel\\coprod): conversely, \\cancel\\coprod denotes statistical dependence, indicating that the distribution of one variable is influenced by the other. For example, A \\cancel\\coprod Y(a) implies that the treatment assignment is related to the potential outcomes, potentially introducing bias into causal estimates.\nConditioning (|): conditioning, denoted by the vertical line |, allows for specifying contexts or conditions under which independence or dependence holds.\n\nConditional Independence (A \\coprod Y(a)|L): This means that once we account for a set of variables L, the treatment and potential outcomes are independent. This condition is often the basis for strategies aiming to control for confounding.\nConditional Dependence (A \\cancel\\coprod Y(a)|L): States that potential outcomes and treatments are not independent after conditioning on L, indicating a need for careful consideration in the analysis to avoid biased causal inferences."

That is, we want to know if our findings carry beyond the sample population to the target population. We fail when our results do not generalise as we think. More fundamentally, we fail when we have not clearly defined our question or our target population.\nThe Concept of Internal Validity: the extent to which the associations we obtain from data reflect causality. In psychological science, we use “independent variable” and “dependent variable.” Sometimes we use the terms “exogenous variable” and “endogenous variable.” Sometimes we use the term “predictor variable” to describe the “dependent” or “endogenous” variable. These words are confusing. When asking “What if?” questions, we want to understand what would happen if we intervened. In this course, we will use the term “treatment” or, equivalently the term “exposure” to denote the intervention; we will use the term “outcome” to denote the effect of an intervention.1\n\n\nDuring the first part of the course, our primary focus will be on challenges to internal validity from confounding bias."

    "text": "Upshot\nANOVA partitions variance into between-group and within-group components, while regression models the mean of the dependent variable as a linear function of the independent (including categorical) variables. For many questions, ANOVA is appropriate, however, when we are comparing groups, we often want a finer-grained interpretation. Regression is built for obtaining this finer grain understanding. We will return to regression over the next few weeks and use regression to hone your skills in R. Later, Along the way, you’ll learn more about data visualisation, modelling, and reporting.\nquarto-executable-code-5450563D\n# graph the output of the parameters table\n# visualisation\nplot(table_fit)\n\nExercise 2\nPerform a linear regression analysis using R. Follow the detailed instructions below to simulate the necessary data, execute the regression, and report your findings:\n\nSimulate Data:\n\nGenerate two continuous variables, Y and A, with n = 100 observations each.\nThe variable A should have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (sd) of 10.\n\nDefine the Relationship:\n\nSimulate the variable Y such that it is linearly related to A with a specified effect size. The effect size of A on Y must be explicitly defined as 2.\n\nIncorporate an Error Term:\n\nWhen simulating Y, include an error term with a standard deviation (sd) of 20 to introduce variability.\n\nRegression Analysis:\n\nUse the lm() function in R to regress Y on A.\nEnsure the regression model captures the specified effect of A on Y.\n\nReport the Results:\n\nOutput the regression model summary to examine the coefficients, including the effect of A on Y, and assess the model’s overall fit and significance.\n\n\nHere is a template to get you started. Copy the code and paste it into your R script.\nquarto-executable-code-5450563D\n#| echo: true\n#| eval: false\n\n\nlibrary(parameters)\n#  seed for reproducibility\nset.seed( ) # numbers go in brackets\n\n# number of observations\nn &lt;-   # number goes here\n\n# simulate data for variable A with specified mean and sd\nA &lt;- rnorm(n, \n           mean = , # set your number here \n           sd = )# set your number here \n\n# define the specified effect size of A on Y\nbeta_A &lt;-   # define your effect with a number here \n\n\n# simulate data and make data frame in one step\n\ndf_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  # simulate data for variable A with specified mean and sd\n  A = A, # from above\n  Y = 5 + beta_A * A + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 20) #  effect is intercept + ...\n)\n\n# view\nhead(df_3)\nstr(df_3)\n\n#  linear regression of Y on A\nfit_3 &lt;- lm(Y ~ A, data = df_3)\n\n#  results (standard code)\n# summary(model)\n\n# time saving reports\nparameters::model_parameters(fit_3)\nreport(fit_3)\n\nStep 5: Simulating Data Frames\nData frames are used in R to store data tables. To simulate a dataset with both continuous and categorical data, you can combine the above steps:\nquarto-executable-code-5450563D\n# create a data frame with simulated data for ID, Gender, Age, and Income\ndata_frame &lt;- data.frame(\n  # generate a sequence of IDs from 1 to n\n  ID = 1:n,\n  \n  # randomly assign 'Male' or 'Female' to each observation\n  Gender = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  \n  # simulate 'Age' data: normally distributed with mean 30 and sd 5\n  Age = rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 5),\n  \n  # simulate 'Income' data: normally distributed with mean 50000 and sd 10000\n  Income = rnorm(n, mean = 50000, sd = 10000)\n)\nNote that you can sample probabilistically for your groups\nquarto-executable-code-5450563D\nn &lt;- 100 # total number of observations\n\n# sample 'Gender' with a 40/60 proportion for Male/Female\nGender = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.6))"

    "section": "The Five Elementary Structures of Causality",
    "text": "The Five Elementary Structures of Causality\nJudea Pearl proved that all elementary structures of causality can be represented graphically (Pearl 2009). Figure 3 presents this five elementary structures.\n\nPearl, Judea. 2009. Causality. Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Five elementary structures. This figure is adapted from (Bulbulia 2023).\n\nBulbulia, J. A. 2023. “Causal Diagrams (Directed Acyclic Graphs): A Practical Guide.”\n\n\n\nThe structures are as follows:\n\nTwo Variables:\n\nCausality Absent: There is no causal effect between variables A and B. They do not influence each other, denoted as A \\coprod B, indicating they are statistically independent.\nCausality: Variable A causally affects variable B. This relationship suggests an association between them, denoted as A \\cancel\\coprod B, indicating they are statistically dependent.\n\nThree Variables:\n\nFork: Variable A causally affects both B and C. Variables B and C are conditionally independent given A, denoted as B \\coprod C | A. This structure implies that knowing A removes any association between B and C due to their common cause.\nChain: A causal chain exists where C is affected by B, which in turn is affected by A. Variables A and C are conditionally independent given B, denoted as A \\coprod C | B. This indicates that B mediates the effect of A on C, and knowing B breaks the association between A and C.\nCollider: Variable C is affected by both A and B, which are independent. However, conditioning on C induces an association between A and B, denoted as A \\cancel\\coprod B | C. This structure is unique because it suggests that A and B, while initially independent, become associated when we account for their common effect C.\n\n\nOnce we understand the basic relationships between two variables, we can build upon these to create more complex relationships. These structures help us see how statistical independences and dependencies emerge from the data, allowing us to clarify the causal relationships we presume exist. Such clarity is crucial for ensuring that confounders are balanced across treatment groups, given all measured confounders, so that Y(a) \\coprod A | L.\nYou might wonder, “If not from the data, where do our assumptions about causality come from?” This question will come up repeatedly throughout the course. The short answer is that our assumptions are based on existing knowledge. This reliance on current knowledge might seem counterintuitive for buiding scientific knowledge-— shouldn’t we use data to build knowledge, not the other way around? Yes, but it is not that straightforward. Data often hold the answers we’re looking for but can be ambiguous. When the causal structure is unclear, it is important to sketch out different causal diagrams, explore their implications, and, if necessary, conduct separate analyses based on these diagrams.\nOtto Neurath, an Austrian philosopher and a member of the Vienna Circle, famously used the metaphor of a ship that must be rebuilt at sea to describe the process of scientific theory and knowledge development.\n\nDuhem has shown … that every statement about any happening is saturated with hypotheses of all sorts and that these in the end are derived from our whole world-view. We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood, the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction. (Neurath 1973, 199)\n\nNeurath, Otto. 1973. “Anti-Spengler.” In Empiricism and Sociology, edited by Marie Neurath and Robert S. Cohen, 158–213. Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-2525-6_6.\n\nThis quotation emphasises the iterative process that accumulates scientific knowledge; new insights are cast from the foundation of existing knowledge. Causal diagrams are at home in Neurath’s boat. The tradition of science that believes that knowledge develops from the results of statistical tests applied to data should be resisted. The data alone typically do not contain the answers we seek."

    "text": "The Four Rules of Confounding Control\nFigure 4 describe the four elementary rules of confounding control:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Four rules of confounding control\n\n\n\n\nCondition on Common Cause or its Proxy: this rule applies to settings in which the treatment (A) and the outcome (Y) share common causes. By conditioning on these common causes, we block the open backdoor paths that could introduce bias into our causal estimates. Controlling for these common causes (or their proxies) helps tp isolate the specific effect of A on Y. (We do not draw a path from $ A Y$ because we do not assume this path.)\nDo Not Condition on a Mediator: this rule applies to settings in which the variable L is a mediator of A \\to Y. Here, conditioning on a mediator will bias the total causal effect estimate. Later in the course, we will discuss the assumptions required for causal mediation. For now, if we are interested in total effect estimates, we must not condition on a mediator. Here we draw the path from A \\to Y to ensure that if such a path exists, it will not become biased from our conditioning strategy.\nDo Not Condition on a Collider: this rule applies to settings in which we L is a common effect of A and Y. Conditioning on a collider may invoke a spurious association. Last week we considered an example in which marriage caused wealth and happiness caused wealth. Conditioning on wealth in this setting will induce an association between happiness and marriage. Why? If we know the outcome, wealth, then we know there are at least two ways of wealth. Among those wealthy but low on happiness, we can predict that they are more likely to be married, for how else would they be wealthy? Similarly, among those who are wealthy and are not married, we can predict that they are happy, for how else would they be wealthy if not through marriage? These relationships are predictable entirely without a causal association between marriage and happiness!\nProxy Rule: Conditioning on a Descendent Is Akin to Conditioning on Its Parent: this rule applies to settings in which we L’ is an effect from another variable L. The graph considers when L’ is downstream of a collider. For example, suppose we condition on home ownership, which is an effect of wealth. Such conditioning will open up a non-causal path without causation because home ownership is a proxy for wealth. Consider, if someone owns a house but is not married, they are more likely to be happy, for how else could they accumulate the wealth required for home ownership? Likewise, if someone is unhappy and owns a house, we can infer that they are more likely to be married because how else would they be wealthy? Conditioning on a proxy for a collider here is akin to conditioning on the collider itself.\n\nHowever, we can also use the proxy rule to reduce bias. Return to the earlier example in which there is an unmeasured common cause of marriage and happiness, which we called “cultural upbringing” Suppose we have not measured this variable but have measured proxies for this variable, such as country of birth, childhood religion, number of languages one speaks, and others. By controlling for baseline values of these proxies, we can exert more control over unmeasured confounding. Even if bias is not eliminated, we should reduce bias wherever possible, which includes not introducing new biases, such as mediator bias, along the way. Later in the course, we will teach you how to perform sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of your results to unmeasured confounding. Sensitivity analysis is critical because where the data are observational, we cannot entirely rule out unmeasured confounding."

    "section": "Course Learning Objectives",
    "text": "Course Learning Objectives\n\nEthical Reasoning. Beginning in week 1, we will explore questions that are typically reserved for philosophy courses but are central to the conduct of psychology: why do we need to think about right and wrong in science? What if different people have different ideas about what is right and wrong in science? Is there hope for ethical progress? Can science play a role in ethical progress? We will provide you with a set of strategies for addressing these questions.\nProgramming in R. Beginning in week 2, we will teach you the basics of programming in the statistical language R. The past several decades have brought extraordinary new tools to psychological scientists, many of which require literacy in computer programming. While some of you may find the thought of programming thrilling, others may find it terrifying or boring! We promise that programming can be fun. This course is designed to help you find that joy.\nUnderstanding measurement. Beginning in week 3 the course will turn its focus to developing skills for constructing and validating measures in cross-cultural research. Again these skills will be invaluable for a wide range of tasks you may face in psychological science and will help you to address problems that will arise in other areas of your research and work. Measurement will occupy our attention through week 6.\nUnderstanding causal inference. Beginning in week 7 and for the following four weeks, the course will impart skills that you require to disentangle causation from correlation. Again our focus will be on the special problems that arise for cultural datasets. Notably, in psychological science, causal inference remains underdeveloped, and the material in this part of the course will position you to make potentially important contributions, whether or not your interests lie in cross-cultural psychology."

Assign time indices to your variables.\nOrganize your variables chronologically.\nSimplify your graph by removing unnecessary nodes that don’t impact the assessment of bias between an exposure and an outcome.\nKeep in mind that Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are qualitative tools. They don’t represent non-linear associations or interactions.\nAvoid depicting interactions by crossing arrows.\nRemember that DAGs are distinct from graphs used in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Be cautious of SEM literature, as it often overlooks the assumptions needed for causal inference."

Solution: Collect time series data or clarify assumptions when unavailable.\nCommon causes of exposure and outcome: Address this by including common causes in your statistical model (e.g., using regression).\nConditioning on a mediator: Avoid this unless mediation is of interest.\nConditioning on a collider: Refrain from doing this.\nBias induced by conditioning on a confounder’s descendant: Draw your DAG and follow guidelines for points 1-4.\n\nImportant Note 1: In observational studies, it’s impossible to guarantee complete control for confounding. Always conduct sensitivity analyses. Techniques for sensitivity analyses will be discussed next week.\nImportant Note 2: Methods for computing causal effects for group comparisons will be covered in the following week’s lecture."

    "section": "What is Regression?",
    "text": "What is Regression?\nBroadly speaking, a regression model is a method for inferring the expected average features of a population and its variance conditional on other features of the population as measured in a sample.\nWe’ll see that regression encompasses more than this definition; however, this definition makes a start.\nTo understand regression, then, we need to understand the following jargon words: population, sample, measurement, and inference.\n\nWhat is a population?\nIn science, a population is a hypothetical construct. It is the set of all potential members of a set of things. In psychological science, that set is typically a collection of individuals. We want to understand “The population of all human beings?” or “The New Zealand adult population”; or “The population of undergraduates who may be recruited for IPRP in New Zealand.”\n\n\nWhat is a sample?\nA sample is a randomly realised sub-population from the larger abstract population that a scientific community hopes to generalise about.\nThink of selecting balls randomly from an urn. When pulled at random, the balls may inform us about the urn’s contents. For example, if we select one white ball and one black ball, we may infer that the balls in the urn are not all white or all black.\n\n\nWhat is “measurement”?\nA measure is a tool or method for obtaining numerical descriptions of a sample. We often call measures “scales.”\nA measurement is the numerical description we obtain from sensors such as statistical surveys, census data, twitter feeds, & etc.\nIn the course, we have encountered numerical scales, ordinal scales, and factors. The topic of measurement in psychology is very broad. As we shall see, the trail of the serpent of measurement runs across comparative psychological research.\nIt is essential to remember that measures can be prone to error.\nError-prone scales may nevertheless be helpful. However, we need to investigate their utility against the backdrop of specific interests and purposes.\n\n\nWhat is a parameter?\nIn regression, we combine measurements on samples with probability theory to guess about the properties of a population we will never observe. We call these properties “parameters.”\n\n\nWhat is statistical inference?\nThe bulk of statistical inference consists of educated guessing about population parameters.\n\n\nProbability distributions and statistical guessing\nInference is possible because the parameters of naturally occurring populations are structured by data-generating processes that are approximated by probability distributions. A probability distribution is a mathematical function describing a random event’s probability. Today we will be focusing on height.1\n1 The relationship of probability distributions and data-generating processes is complex, intriguing, and both historically and philosophically rich \\dots. Because our interests are applied, we will hardly touch up this richness in this course.Today we will discuss the “normal” or “Gaussian distribution.” A large number of data-generating processes in nature conform the normal distribution.\nLet’s consider some examples of randomly generated samples, which we will obtain using R’s rnorm function.\n\n\n10-person sample of heights\n\n# seed\nset.seed(123)\n\n# generate 10 samples, average 170, sd = 20\ndraws_10 &lt;- rnorm(10, mean = 170, sd = 20)\n\n# ggplot quick-histogram\nggplot2::qplot(draws_10, binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100-person sample of heights\n\n# reproducibility \nset.seed(123)\n\n# generate 100 samples, average 170, sd = 20\ndraws_100 &lt;-rnorm(100, mean = 170, sd = 20)\n\n# graph\nggplot2::qplot(\n  draws_100, binwidth = 2\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10000-person sample of heights\n\n# reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# N = 10,000\ndraws_10000 &lt;- rnorm(1e5, mean = 170, sd = 20)\n\n# plot\nggplot2::qplot(draws_10000, binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I use regression to infer a population parameter?\nWe can use R to investigate the average height of our imaginary population from which the preceding samples were randomly drawn. We do this in R by writing an “intercept-only” model as follows:\n\n# syntax for an intercept-only model\nmodel &lt;- lm(outcome ~ 1, data = data)\n\n# base R summary\nsummary(model)\n\nUsing the previous simulations:\nN = 10 random draws\n\n#|code-fold: false\n\n#write the model and get a nice table for it\nsjPlot::tab_model(lm(draws_10 ~ 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDependent variable\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n171.49\n157.85 – 185.14\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n10\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.000 / 0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN = 100 random draws\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(lm(draws_100 ~ 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDependent variable\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n171.81\n168.19 – 175.43\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n100\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.000 / 0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN = 10,000 random draws\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(lm(draws_10000 ~ 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDependent variable\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n170.02\n169.90 – 170.14\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n100000\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.000 / 0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we notice about the relationship between sample size the estimated population average?\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(lm(draws_10 ~ 1),\n                  lm(draws_100 ~ 1),\n                  lm(draws_10000 ~ 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDependent variable\nDependent variable\nDependent variable\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n171.49\n157.85 – 185.14\n&lt;0.001\n171.81\n168.19 – 175.43\n&lt;0.001\n170.02\n169.90 – 170.14\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n10\n100\n100000\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.000 / 0.000\n0.000 / 0.000\n0.000 / 0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression with a single co-variate\nDo mothers’s heights predict daughter height? If so, what is the magnitude of the relationship?\nFrancis Galton is credited with inventing regression analysis. Galton observed that offspring’s heights tend to fall between parental height and the population average, which Galton termed “regression to the mean.” Galton sought a method for educated guessing about heights, and this led to fitting a line of regression by a method called “least squares” (For a history, see: here).\nThe following dataset is from “The heredity of height” by Karl Pearson and Alice Lee (1903)(Pearson and Lee 1903). I obtained it from (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020). Let’s use this dataset to investigate the relationship between mothers’ and daughters’ heights.\n\nPearson, Karl, and Alice Lee. 1903. “On the Laws of Inheritance in Man: I. Inheritance of Physical Characters.” Biometrika 2 (4): 357–462.\n\n# import data\ndf_pearson_lee &lt;-\n  data.frame(read.table(\n    url(\n      \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/master/PearsonLee/data/MotherDaughterHeights.txt\"\n    ),\n    header = TRUE\n  ))\n\n# save\n# saveRDS(df_pearson_lee, here::here(\"data\", \"df_pearson_lee\"))\n\n# Center mother's height for later example\ndf_pearson_lee_centered &lt;- df_pearson_lee |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(mother_height_c = as.numeric(scale(\n    mother_height, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE\n  )))\n\n# skimr::skim(df_pearson_lee_centered)\n\nPearson and Lee collected 5,524 observations from mother/daughter height pairs. Let’s examine the data, first by plotting the relationship.\nWhat is happening here?\n\n# explore pearson lee data\nexplore_md &lt;-\n  ggplot2::ggplot(data = df_pearson_lee_centered, aes(y = daughter_height, x = mother_height)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) +\n  labs(title = \"The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height\") +\n  ylab(\"Daughter's height\") +\n  xlab(\"Mother's height\") + theme_classic()\nexplore_md\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a linear predictive relationship between these two parameters? In regression we examine the line of best fit.\n\n# regression \nm1 &lt;-\n  lm(daughter_height ~ mother_height, data = df_pearson_lee_centered)\n\n# graph\nsjPlot::tab_model(m1)\n\n\n\n\n\n \ndaughter height\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n29.80\n28.25 – 31.35\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nmother height\n0.54\n0.52 – 0.57\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n5524\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.252 / 0.252\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot the coefficient, but in a model with one predictor, this isn’t very informative. However, as we continue in the course, we’ll see that plotting coefficients can be easier than deciphering the numbers in tables. Here are two methods for plotting.\n\n# get model parameters\nt_m1&lt;-parameters::model_parameters(m1,  \n                                   ci = 0.95)\n# plot \nplot(t_m1) +\n  labs(title = \"The relationship between mothers height and daughter's height\") + \n  ylab(\"Daughter's height\")"

    "section": "Assumptions of Regression",
    "text": "Assumptions of Regression\nFrom Gelman and Hill (Gelman and Hill 2006)\n\nValidity\n\nThe most important is that the data you are analyzing should map to the research question you are trying to answer (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020, 152)\n\nRepresentativeness\n\nA regression model is fit to data and is used to make inferences about a larger population, hence the implicit assumption in interpreting regression coefficients is that the sample is representative of the population. (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020, 153)\n\n\nLinearity\n\nThe most important mathematical assumption of the linear regression model is that its deterministic component is a linear function of the separate predictors: y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 +···. If additivity is violated, it might make sense to transform the data (for example, if y = abc, then log y = log a + log b + log c) or to add interactions. If linearity is violated, perhaps a predictor should be put in as 1/x or log(x) instead of simply linearly. Or a more complicated relationship could be expressed using a nonlinear function such as a spline or Gaussian process, (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020, 153)\n\nIndependence of errors\n\nThe simple regression model assumes that the errors from the prediction line are independent, an assumption that is violated in time series, spatial, and multilevel settings (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020, 153)\n\nEqual variance of errors\n\n\n…unequal variance does not affect the most important aspect of a regression model, which is the form of the predictors (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020, 153)\n\n\nNormality of errors (statistical independence)\n\n\nThe regression assumption that is generally least important is that the errors are normally distributed. In fact, for the purpose of estimating the regression line (as compared to predicting individual data points), the assumption of normality is barely important at all. Thus, in contrast to many regression textbooks, we do not recommend diagnostics of the normality of re-gression residuals. (Gelman and Hill 2006, 46)\n\n\nA good way to diagnose violations of some of the assumptions just considered (importantly, linearity) is to plot the residuals versus fitted values or simply individual predictors.(Gelman and Hill 2006, 46)\n\nGelman, Andrew, and Jennifer Hill. 2006. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge university press.\n\n\nCommon Confusions\n\nRegressions do not automatically give us “effects”\nPeople use the work “effect”, but that is not what regression gives us, by default.\n\n\n“Normality Assumption”\nGelman and Hill note that the “normality” assumption is the least important. The assumption pertains to the normality of residuals.\n\n\nStatistical Independence\nThis is the motivation for doing multi-level modelling: to condition on dependencies in the data. However, multi-level modelling can produce new problems if the error terms in the model are not independent of the outcome.\n\n\nExternal Validity (wrong population)\nWe sample from undergraduates, but infer about the human population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNOTE: The concept of “better model fit” is relative to our interests and purposes. A better (lower) AIC statistic does not tell us whether a model is better for better causal inference. We must assess whether a model satisfies the assumptions necessary for valid causal inference."

    "text": "Appendix 2: Conceptual Background\nSome preliminaries about science.\n\nScience begins with a question\nScience begins with a question about the world. The first step in science, then, is to clarify what you want to know.\nBecause science is a social practice, you will also need to clarify why your question is interesting: so what?\nIn short, know your question.\n\n\nScientific model (or theory)\nSometimes, scientists are interested in specific features of the world: how did virus x originate? Such a question might have a forensic interest: what constellation of events gave rise to a novel infectious disease?\nScientists typically seek generalisations. How do infectious diseases evolve? How do biological organisms evolve? Such questions have applied interests. How can we better prevent infectious diseases? How did life originate?\nA scientific model proposes how nature is structured (and unstructured). For example, the theory of evolution by natural selection proposes that life emerges from variation, inheritance, and differential reproduction/survival.\nTo evaluate a scientific model, scientists must make generalisations beyond individual cases. This is where statistics shines.\n\n\nWhat is statistics?\nMathematics is a logic of certainty.\nStatistics is a logic of uncertainty.\nA statistical model uses the logic of probability to make better guesses.\n\n\nApplications of statistical models in science\nScientific models seek to explain how nature is structured. Where scientific models conflict, we can combine statistical models with data collection to evaluate the credibility of of one theoretical model over others. To do this, a scientific model must make distinct, non-trivial predictions about the world.\nIf the predictions are not distinct, the observations will not enable a shift in credibility for one theory over another. Consider the theory that predicts any observation. Such a theory would be better classified as a conspiracy theory; it is compatible with any evidence."

    "text": "Why Regression Is Not Enough\n\nMethodology\n\nData Generation: we simulate a dataset for 1,000 individuals, where access to green space (A) influences exercise (L), which in turn affects happiness (Y$). The simulation is based on predefined parameters that establish L as a mediator between A and Y.\nParameter Definitions:\n\nThe probability of access to green space (A) is set at 0.5.\nThe effect of A on L (exercise) is quantified by \\beta = 2.\nThe effect of L on Y (happiness) is quantified by \\delta = 1.5.\nStandard deviations for L and Y are set at 1 and 1.5, respectively.\n\nModel Specifications:\n\nModel 1 (Correct Assumption): fits a linear regression model assuming L as a mediator, including both A and L as regressors on Y. This model aligns with the data-generating process and correctly identifies L as a mediator.\nModel 2 (Incorrect Assumption): fits a linear regression model including only A as a regressor on Y, omitting the mediator L. This model assesses the direct effect of A on Y without accounting for mediation.\n\nAnalysis and Comparison: the analysis compares the estimated effects of A on Y under both model specifications. By including L as a predictor in Model 1, we account for its mediating role, whereas Model 2 overlooks this aspect by excluding L from the analysis.\nPresentation: the results are displayed in a comparative table formatted for publication. The table contrasts the regression coefficients and significance levels obtained under each model, highlighting the effect of correctly versus incorrectly assuming the role of L in the relationship between A and Y.\n\n\n# load libraries\n!require(kableExtra)){install.packages(\"kableExtra\")} # tables\nif(!require(gtsummary)){install.packages(\"gtsummary\")} # tables\n\n# simulation seed\nset.seed(123) #  reproducibility\n\n# define the parameters \nn = 1000 # Number of observations\np = 0.5  # Probability of A = 1 (access to greenspace)\nalpha = 0 # Intercept for L (exercise)\nbeta = 2  # Effect of A on L \ngamma = 1 # Intercept for Y \ndelta = 1.5 # Effect of L on Y\nsigma_L = 1 # Standard deviation of L\nsigma_Y = 1.5 # Standard deviation of Y\n\n# simulate the data: fully mediated effect by L\nA = rbinom(n, 1, p) # binary exposure variable\nL = alpha + beta*A + rnorm(n, 0, sigma_L) # mediator L affect by A\nY = gamma + delta*L + rnorm(n, 0, sigma_Y) # Y affected only by L,\n\n# make the data frame\ndata = data.frame(A = A, L = L, Y = Y)\n\n# fit regression in which L is assumed to be a mediator\n# (cross-sectional data is consistent with this model)\nfit_1 &lt;- lm( Y ~ A + L, data = data)\n\n# fit regression in which L is assumed to be a mediator\n# (cross-sectional data is also consistent with this model)\nfit_2 &lt;- lm( Y ~ A, data = data)\n\n# create gtsummary tables for each regression model\ntable1 &lt;- gtsummary::tbl_regression(fit_1)\ntable2 &lt;- gtsummary::tbl_regression(fit_2)\n\n# merge the tables for comparison\ntable_comparison &lt;- gtsummary::tbl_merge(\n  list(table1, table2),\n  tab_spanner = c(\"Model: Exercise assumed confounder\", \n                  \"Model: Exercise assumed to be a mediator\")\n)\n# make latex table (for publication)\nmarkdown_table_0 &lt;- as_kable_extra(table_comparison, \n                                   format = \"latex\", \n                                   booktabs = TRUE)\n# print latex table (note, you might prefer \"markdown\" or another format)                                \nmarkdown_table_0"

The first step in science, then, is to clarify what you want to know.\nBecause science is a social practice, you will also need to clarify why your question is interesting: so what?\nIn short, know your question.\n\n\nScientific model (or theory)\nSometimes, scientists are interested in specific features of the world: how did virus x originate? Such a question might have a forensic interest: what constellation of events gave rise to a novel infectious disease?\nScientists typically seek generalisations. How do infectious diseases evolve? How do biological organisms evolve? Such questions have applied interests. How can we better prevent infectious diseases? How did life originate?\nA scientific model proposes how nature is structured (and unstructured). For example, the theory of evolution by natural selection proposes that life emerges from variation, inheritance, and differential reproduction/survival.\nTo evaluate a scientific model, scientists must make generalisations beyond individual cases. This is where statistics shines.\n\n\nWhat is statistics?\nMathematics is a logic of certainty.\nStatistics is a logic of uncertainty.\nA statistical model uses the logic of probability to make better guesses.\n\n\nApplications of statistical models in science\nScientific models seek to explain how nature is structured. Where scientific models conflict, we can combine statistical models with data collection to evaluate the credibility of of one theoretical model over others. To do this, a scientific model must make distinct, non-trivial predictions about the world.\nIf the predictions are not distinct, the observations will not enable a shift in credibility for one theory over another. Consider the theory that predicts any observation. Such a theory would be better classified as a conspiracy theory; it is compatible with any evidence."

We’ll come back to this point in later lectures.\n\n\nModel evaluation\nReviewers will sometime ask you to assess model fit.\nA simple, but flawed way to assess accuracy of your model fit is to compare a model with one covariate with a simple intercept-only model and to assess improvement in either the AIC statistic or the BIC statistic. The BIC is similar to the AIC but adds a penalty for extra predictors. An absolute improvement in either statistic of n &gt; 10 is considered to be a “better” model.\nWe can use the performance package to generate a table that compares model fits.\n\n# load library \nlibrary(performance)\n# intercept only\nfig_intercept_only &lt;- lm(daughter_height ~ 1, data = df_pearson_lee)\n\n# covariate added\nfig_covariate &lt;- lm(daughter_height ~ mother_height, data = df_pearson_lee)\n\n# evaluate\nperformance::compare_performance(fig_intercept_only, fig_covariate)\n\n# Comparison of Model Performance Indices\n\nName               | Model |   AIC (weights) |  AICc (weights) |   BIC (weights) |    R2 | R2 (adj.) |  RMSE | Sigma\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfig_intercept_only |    lm | 26300.0 (&lt;.001) | 26300.0 (&lt;.001) | 26313.2 (&lt;.001) | 0.000 |     0.000 | 2.615 | 2.615\nfig_covariate      |    lm | 24698.5 (&gt;.999) | 24698.5 (&gt;.999) | 24718.4 (&gt;.999) | 0.252 |     0.252 | 2.262 | 2.262\n\n\nWhat was the model “improvement?”\n\n# improved fit\nBIC(fig_intercept_only) - BIC(fig_covariate)\n\n[1] 1594.839\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a report\nThis is easy with the report package\nFor example:\n\nreport::report_statistics(fig_covariate)\n\nbeta = 29.80, 95% CI [28.25, 31.35], t(5522) = 37.70, p &lt; .001; Std. beta = 7.21e-15, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.02]\nbeta = 0.54, 95% CI [0.52, 0.57], t(5522) = 43.12, p &lt; .001; Std. beta = 0.50, 95% CI [0.48, 0.52]\n\n\nOr, if you want a longer report:\n\nreport::report(fig_covariate)\n\nUse statistically significant in place of significant. This will avoid misleading your audience into thinking your result is important when what you intend to communicate is that it is reliable."

We have seen this for omitted variable bias. A and Y are d-separated conditional on L, and that’s our motivation for including L. These concepts are tricky, but they get easier with practice.\nTo add some grit to our exploration of mediation lets simulate data that are consistent with our mediation DAG\nFirst we ask, is X is related to Y?\n\nfit_mediation &lt;- lm(y ~ x_s, data = df)\nparameters::model_parameters(fit_mediation)\n\nParameter   | Coefficient |   SE |        95% CI | t(98) |      p\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |        0.19 | 0.14 | [-0.08, 0.47] |  1.41 | 0.161 \nx s         |        1.66 | 0.14 | [ 1.38, 1.93] | 12.00 | &lt; .001\n\n\nYes.\nNext we ask, is A related to Y conditional on M?\n\nfit_total_mediated_effect &lt;- lm(y ~ x_s + m_s, data = df)\nparameters::model_parameters(fit_total_mediated_effect) |&gt; parameters::print_html()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nCoefficient\nSE\n95% CI\nt(97)\np\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.19\n0.10\n(4.92e-03, 0.38)\n2.04\n0.044\n\n\nx s\n0.77\n0.13\n(0.51, 1.02)\n6.00\n&lt; .001\n\n\nm s\n1.33\n0.13\n(1.07, 1.58)\n10.34\n&lt; .001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, but notice this is a different question.

Why is this? The answer is that once our model knows m it does not obtain any new information by knowing x.\nIf we were interested in assessing x\\toy but x were to effect y through m (i.e x\\tom\\toy) then conditioning on m would block the path from x\\toy. Including m leads to Pipe Confounding.\nIn experiments we should never condition on a post-treatment variable."

    "text": "More examples of counfounding/de-confounding\nHere’s another example from recent NZAVS research\n\ntidy_ggdag &lt;- dagify(\n  WB ~ belief + age_within + age_between + partner + nzdep + urban + male + pols + empl,\n  WB ~~ partner,\n  belief ~ age_within + age_between + male + ethn,\n  partner ~ nzdep + age_within + age_between + belief, \n  nzdep ~ empl + age_within + age_between,\n  pols ~ age_within + age_between + empl + ethn,\n  empl ~  edu + ethn + age_within + age_between,\n  exposure =  \"belief\",\n  outcome =   \"WB\")|&gt;\n  tidy_dagitty()\n\n# graph\ntidy_ggdag |&gt;\n  ggdag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can examine which variables to select, conditional on the causal assumptions of this dag\n\n# graph adjustment sets\nggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(tidy_ggdag, node_size = 14) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + theme_dag_blank()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method reveals two adjustments sets: {age, employment, male, political conservativism, and time}, and {age, ethnicty, male, and time.} We report the second set because employment is likely to contain more measurement error: some are not employed because they cannot find employment, others because they are not seeking employment (e.g. retirement).\n\nUnmeasured causes\nReturn to the previous example of R and C on K6 distress, but imagine an underlying common cause of both C and R (say childhood upbringing) called “U”:\n\ndag_m3 &lt;- dagify(\n  K ~ C + R,\n  C ~ U,\n  R ~ U,\n  exposure = \"C\",\n  outcome = \"K\",\n  latent = \"U\"\n) |&gt;\n  tidy_dagitty(layout = \"nicely\")\n\ndag_m3 |&gt;\n  ggdag()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we assess the relationship of C on K?\nWe can close the backdoor from U through R by conditioning on R\n\nggdag::ggdag_adjustment_set(dag_m3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside, we can simulate this relationship using the following code:\n\n# C -&gt; K &lt;- R\n# C &lt;- U -&gt; R\nn &lt;- 100\nU &lt;- rnorm( n )\nR &lt;- rnorm( n , U )\nC &lt;- rnorm( n , U )\nK &lt;- rnorm( n , R - C )\nd_sim3 &lt;- data.frame(K = K, R = R, U = U, C = C )\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between smoking and cardiac arrest?\nThis example is from the ggdag package, by Malcolm Barrett here\n\nsmoking_ca_dag &lt;- dagify(\n  cardiacarrest ~ cholesterol,\n  cholesterol ~ smoking + weight,\n  smoking ~ unhealthy,\n  weight ~ unhealthy,\n  labels = c(\n    \"cardiacarrest\" = \"Cardiac\\n Arrest\",\n    \"smoking\" = \"Smoking\",\n    \"cholesterol\" = \"Cholesterol\",\n    \"unhealthy\" = \"Unhealthy\\n Lifestyle\",\n    \"weight\" = \"Weight\"\n  ),\n  latent = \"unhealthy\",\n  exposure = \"smoking\",\n  outcome = \"cardiacarrest\"\n)\n\nggdag(smoking_ca_dag,\n      text = FALSE,\n      use_labels = \"label\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we condition on to close any open backdoor paths, while avoiding colliders? We imagine that unhealthy lifestyle is unmeasured.\n\nggdag_adjustment_set(\n  smoking_ca_dag,\n  text = FALSE,\n  use_labels = \"label\",\n  shadow = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we control for cholesterol?\n\nggdag_dseparated(\n  smoking_ca_dag,\n  controlling_for = c(\"weight\", \"cholesterol\"),\n  text = FALSE,\n  use_labels = \"label\",\n  collider_lines = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControlling for intermediate variables may also induce bias, because it decomposes the total effect of x on y into its parts. (ggdag documentation)\n\n\n\nSelection bias in sampling\nThis example is from https://ggdag.malco.io/articles/bias-structures.html\n\nLet’s say we’re doing a case-control study and want to assess the effect of smoking on glioma, a type of brain cancer. We have a group of glioma patients at a hospital and want to compare them to a group of controls, so we pick people in the hospital with a broken bone, since that seems to have nothing to do with brain cancer. However, perhaps there is some unknown confounding between smoking and being in the hospital with a broken bone, like being prone to reckless behavior. In the normal population, there is no causal effect of smoking on glioma, but in our case, we’re selecting on people who have been hospitalized, which opens up a back-door path:\n\n\ncoords_mine &lt;- tibble::tribble(\n  ~name,           ~x,  ~y,\n  \"glioma\",         1,   2,\n  \"hospitalized\",   2,   3,\n  \"broken_bone\",    3,   2,\n  \"reckless\",       4,   1,\n  \"smoking\",        5,   2\n)\n\ndagify(hospitalized ~ broken_bone + glioma,\n       broken_bone ~ reckless,\n       smoking ~ reckless,\n       labels = c(hospitalized = \"Hospitalization\",\n                  broken_bone = \"Broken Bone\",\n                  glioma = \"Glioma\",\n                  reckless = \"Reckless \\nBehavior\",\n                  smoking = \"Smoking\"),\n       coords = coords_mine) |&gt; \n  ggdag_dconnected(\"glioma\", \"smoking\", controlling_for = \"hospitalized\", \n                   text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\", collider_lines = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though smoking doesn’t actually cause glioma, it will appear as if there is an association. Actually, in this case, it may make smoking appear to be protective against glioma, since controls are more likely to be smokers.\n\n\n\nSelection bias in longitudinal research\nSuppose we want to estimate the effect of ethnicity on ecological orientation in a longitudinal dataset where there is selection bias from homeownership (it is easier to reach homeowners by the mail.)\nSuppose the following DAG:\n\ndag_sel &lt;- dagify(\n  retained ~ homeowner,\n  homeowner ~ income + ethnicity,\n  ecologicalvalues ~  ethnicity + income,\n  labels = c(\n    retained = \"retained\",\n    homeowner = \"homeowner\",\n    ethnicity = \"ethnicity\",\n    income = \"income\",\n    ecologicalvalues = \"Ecological \\n Orientation\"\n  ),\n  exposure = \"ethnicity\",\n  outcome = \"ecologicalvalues\"\n) |&gt;\n  control_for(\"retained\")\n\n\ndag_sel |&gt;\n  ggdag_adjust(\n    \"retained\",\n    layout = \"mds\",\n    text = FALSE,\n    use_labels = \"label\",\n    collider_lines = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that “retained” falls downstream from a collider, “home ownership”\n\nggdag_collider(dag_sel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we are stratifying on “retained”, we introduce collider bias in our estimate of ethnicity on ecological values.\n\nggdag_dseparated(\n  dag_sel,\n  controlling_for = \"retained\",\n  text = FALSE,\n  use_labels = \"label\",\n  collider_lines = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever we have an adjustment set\n\nggdag_adjustment_set(dag_sel)"
