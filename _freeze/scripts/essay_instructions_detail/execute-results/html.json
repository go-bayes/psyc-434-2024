If not, state it.\n-   Relevance of the Question: Have I explained its importance? If not, explain.\n-   Subgroup Analysis: Does my question involve a subgroup (e.g., cultural group)? If not, develop a subgroup analysis question.\n-   Causality of the Question: Is my question causal? Briefly explain what this means with reference to the potential outcomes framework.\n-   State how you will use time-series data to address causality.\n-   Define your exposure.\n-   Define your outcome(s)\n-   Explain how the the exposure and outcome is relevant to your question.\n-   Define your causal estimand (see: lecture 9). Hint: it is ATE_g\\_risk difference = E\\[Y(1)-(0)\\|G,L\\], where G is your multiple-group indicator and L is your set of baseline confounders.\n\n## Methods\n\n-   Consider any ethical implications.\n-   Explain the sample. Provide descriptive statistics\n-   Discuss inclusion criteria.\n-   Discuss how your sample relates to the \"source population\" (lecture 9.)\n-   Explain NZAVS measures. State the questions used in the items\n-   In your own words describe how the data meet the following assumptions required for causal inference:\n-   Positivity: Can we intervene on the exposure at all levels of the covariates? Use the code I provided to test whether there is change in the exposure from the baseline in the source population(s)\n-   Consistency: Can I interpret what it means to intervene on the exposure?\n-   Exchangeability: Are different versions of the exposure conditionally exchangeable given measured baseline confounders? This requires stating baseline confounders and explaining how they may be related to both the exposure and outcome. As part of this, **you must explain why the baseline measure of your exposure and outcome are included as potential confounders.**\n-   Note: Unmeasured Confounders: Does previous science suggest the presence of unmeasured confounders? (e.g. childhood exposures that are not measured).\n-   Draw a causal diagram: Have I drawn a causal diagram (DAG) to highlight both measured and unmeasured sources of confounding?\n-   Measurement Error: Have I described potential biases from measurement errors? Return to lecture 11.\n-   State that you do not have missing data in this synthetic dataset, but that ordinarily missing data would need to be handled.\n-   State what your estimator will be. Note I've given you the following text to modify:\n\n> The Doubly Robust Estimation method for Subgroup Analysis Estimator is a sophisticated tool combining features of both IPTW and G-computation methods, providing unbiased estimates if either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. The process involves five main steps:\n\n> Step 1 involves the estimation of the propensity score, a measure of the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates and the subgroup indicator. This score is calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, with the model choice depending on the nature of the data and exposure. Weights for each individual are then calculated using this propensity score. These weights depend on the exposure status and are computed differently for exposed and unexposed individuals. The estimation of propensity scores is performed separately within each subgroup stratum.\n\n> Step 2 focuses on fitting a weighted outcome model, making use of the previously calculated weights from the propensity scores. This model estimates the outcome conditional on exposure, covariates, and subgroup, integrating the weights into the estimation process. Unlike in propensity score model estimation, covariates are included as variables in the outcome model. This inclusion makes the method doubly robust - providing a consistent effect estimate if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified, thereby reducing the assumption of correct model specification.\n\n> Step 3 entails the simulation of potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup. These hypothetical scenarios assume universal exposure to the intervention within each subgroup, regardless of actual exposure levels. The expectation of potential outcomes is calculated for each individual in each subgroup, using individual-specific weights. These scenarios are performed for both the current and alternative interventions.\n\n> Step 4 is the estimation of the average causal effect for each subgroup, achieved by comparing the computed expected values of potential outcomes under each intervention level. The difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure within each subgroup.\n\n> Step 5 involves comparing differences in causal effects across groups by calculating the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups. Confidence intervals and standard errors for these calculations are determined using simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023). This step allows for a comprehensive comparison of the impact of different interventions across various subgroups, while encorporating uncertainty.\n\nAlso see the appendix [here](https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-434-2023/content/09-content.html#comprehensive-checklist-for-detailed-reporting-of-a-causal-inferenctial-study-e.g.-assessment-3-option-2)\n\n-   State what E-values are and how you will use them to clarify the risk of unmeasured confounding.\n\n## Results\n\n-   Use the scripts I have provided as a template for your analysis.\n-   Propensity Score Reporting: Detail the process of propensity score derivation, including the model used and any variable transformations: e.g.: `A ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + ....` using logistic regression, all continuous predictors were transformed to z-scores\n    -   WeightIt Package Utilisation: Explicitly mention the use of the 'WeightIt' package in R, including any specific options or parameters used in the propensity score estimation process [@greifer2023a].\n    -   Report if different methods were used to obtain propensity scores, and the reasons behind the choice of methods such as 'ebal', 'energy', and 'ps'.\n    -   If your exposure is continuous only the 'energy' option was used for propensity score estimation.\n    -   Subgroup Estimation: Confirm that the propensity scores for subgroups were estimated separately, and discuss how the weights were subsequently combined with the original data.\n    -   Covariate Balance: Include a Love plot to visually represent covariate balance on the exposure both before and after weighting. The script will generate these plots.\n    -   Weighting Algorithm Statistics: Report the statistics for the weighting algorithms as provided by the WeightIt package, including any measures of balance or fit. The script I gave you will generate this information\n\nExample:\n\n> We estimated propensity scores by fitting a model for the exposure A as it is predicted by the set of baseline covariates defined by L. Because we are interested in effect modification by group, we fit different propensity score models for within strata of G using the `subgroup` command of the `WeightIt` package. Thus the propensity score is the the probability of receiving a value of a treatment (A=a) conditional on the covariates L, and stratum within G. We compared balance using the following methods of weighting: \"ebal\" or entropy balancing, \"energy\" or energy balancing, and \"ps\" or traditional inverse probability of weighting balancing. Of these methods \"ebal\" performed the best. Table X and Figure Y present the results of the ebalancing method.\n\n-   Interpretation of Propensity Scores: we interpret the proposensity scores as yeilding good balance across the exposure conditions.\n\n-   Outcome Regression Model: Clearly report the type of regression model used to estimate outcome model coefficients (e.g., linear regression, Poisson, binomial), and mention if the exposure was interacted with the baseline covariates. Do not report model coefficients as these have no interpretation. Example\n\n> We fit a linear model using maximum likelihood estimation with the outcome Y predicted by the exposure A. We interacted the exposure with all baseline confounders L. Continuous baseline confounders were converted to z-scores, whereas categorical exposures were not. Also interacted with all baseline confounders was a term for the subgroup interactoin. This allowed uas to flexibily fit non-linearities for the modification of the effect of the exposure within levels of the levels of the cultural group strata of interest. We note that model coefficients have no interpretation in this context so are not reported. The remaining steps of Doubly-Robust estimation were performed as outlined in the *Method* section. We calculated confidence intervals and standard errors, using the `clarify` package in R, which relies on simulation based inference for these quantities of interest [@greifer2023]\n\n-   Report the causal estimates.\n    -   ATE contrasts for groups in setting the exposure to for each group in setting level A = a and A = a\\*\n    -   differences between groups in the magnitude of the effects. (ATE_group 1 - ATE_group_2)\n-   Report the E-value: how sensitive are your results to unmeasured confounding? Hint I gave you code that will create a table for you: See [here](https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-434-2023/content/10-content.html)\n\n`table_depression <- tab_ate_subgroup_rd(table_estimates_depression, delta = 1, sd = 1)`\n\n## Discussion\n\nMake sure to hit these points:\n\nConsider the following ideas about what to discuss in one's findings. The order of exposition might be different.\n\n1.  **Summary of results**: What did you find?\n\n2.  **Interpretation of E-values:** Interpret the E-values used for sensitivity analysis. State what they represent in terms of the robustness of the findings to potential unmeasured confounding.\n\n3.  **Causal Effect Interpretation:** What is the interest of the effect, if any, if an effect was observed? Interpret the average causal effect of changing the exposure level within each subgroup, and discuss its relevance to the research question.\n\n4.  **Comparison of Subgroups:** Discuss how differences in causal effect estimates between different subgroups, if observed, or if not observed, contribute to the overall findings of the study.\n\n5.  **Uncertainty and Confidence Intervals:** Consider the uncertainty around the estimated causal effects, and interpret the confidence intervals to understand the precision of the estimates.\n\n6.  **Generalisability and Transportability:** Reflect on the generalizability of the study results to other contexts or populations. Discuss any factors that might influence the transportability of the causal effects found in the study. (Again see lecture 9.)\n\n7.  **Assumptions and Limitations:** Reflect on the assumptions made during the study and identify any limitations in the methodology that could affect the interpretation of results. State that the implications of different intervention levels on potential outcomes are not analysed.\n\n8.  **Theoretical Relevance**: How are these findings relevant to existing theories.\n\n9.  **Replication and Future Research:** Consider how the study could be replicated or expanded upon in future research, and how the findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field.\n\n10. **Real-world Implications:** Discuss the real-world implications of the findings, and how they could be applied in policy, practice, or further research.\n\n## Example anlaysis (week 10)\n\n## Load Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Before running this source code, make sure to update to the current version of R, and to update all existing packages.\n\n# functions\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-bayes/templates/main/functions/funs.R\")\n\n\n# experimental functions (more functions)\nsource(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-bayes/templates/main/functions/experimental_funs.R\"\n)\n\n\n#  If you haven't already, you should have created a folder called \"data\", in your Rstudio project.

Data wrangling is the majority of data analysis. The good news is that R makes wrangling relatively straightforward.\n\n1.  `mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare)))`: This creates a new column called `id` that has unique identification factors for each row in the dataset. It ranges from 1 to the number of rows in the dataset.\n\n2.  The next `mutate` operation is used to convert the `t0_eth_cat`, `t0_urban`, and `t0_gen_cohort` variables to factor type, if they are not already.\n\n3.  The `filter` command is used to subset the dataset to only include rows where the `t0_eth_cat` is either \"euro\" or \"māori\". The original dataset includes data with four different ethnic categories. This command filters out any row not related to these two groups.\n\n4.  `ungroup()` ensures that there's no grouping in the dataframe.\n\n5.  The `mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\"))` step standardizes all numeric columns in the dataset by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (a z-score transformation). The resulting columns are renamed to include \"\\_z\" at the end of their original names.\n\n6.  The `select` function is used to keep only specific columns: the `id` column, any columns that are factors, and any columns that end in \"\\_z\".\n\n7.  The `relocate` functions re-order columns. The first `relocate` places the `id` column at the beginning. The next three `relocate` functions order the rest of the columns based on their names: those starting with \"t0\\_\" are placed before \"t1\\_\" columns, and those starting with \"t2\\_\" are placed after \"t1\\_\" columns.\n\n8.  `droplevels()` removes unused factor levels in the dataframe.\n\n9.  Finally, `skimr::skim(dt)` will print out a summary of the data in the `dt` object using the skimr package. This provides a useful overview of the data, including data types and summary statistics.\n\nThis function seems to be part of a data preparation pipeline in a longitudinal or panel analysis, where observations are ordered over time (indicated by t0\\_, t1\\_, t2\\_, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### ### ### ### ### ### SUBGROUP DATA ANALYSIS: DATA WRANGLING  ### ### ### ###\n\ndt <- dt_prepare|>\n  mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))) |>\n  mutate(\n  t0_eth_cat = as.factor(t0_eth_cat),\n  t0_urban = as.factor(t0_urban),\n  t0_gen_cohort = as.factor(t0_gen_cohort)\n) |>\n  dplyr::filter(t0_eth_cat == \"euro\" |\n                t0_eth_cat == \"māori\") |> # Too few asian and pacific\n  ungroup() |>\n  # transform numeric variables into z scores (improves estimation)\n  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) %>%\n  # select only factors and numeric values that are z-scores\n  select(id, # category is too sparse\n         where(is.factor),\n         ends_with(\"_z\"), ) |>\n  # tidy data frame so that the columns are ordered by time (useful for more complex models)\n  relocate(id, .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))   |>\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t0_\"), .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))  |>\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t2_\"), .after = starts_with(\"t1_\")) |>\n  droplevels()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# checks\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_depression_z)\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_anxiety_z)\n\ndt |>\n  tabyl(t0_eth_cat, t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ) |>\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n# Visualise missingness\nnaniar::vis_miss(dt)\n\n# save your dataframe for future use\n\n# make dataframe\ndt = as.data.frame(dt)\n\n# save data\nsaveRDS(dt, here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Calculate propensity scores\n\nNext we generate propensity scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read  data -- you may start here if you need to repeat the analysis\ndt <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n# get column names\nbaseline_vars_reflective_propensity <- dt|>\n  dplyr::select(starts_with(\"t0\"), -t0_eth_cat) |> colnames()\n\n# define our exposure\nX <- \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen\"\n\n# define subclasses\nS <- \"t0_eth_cat\"\n\n# Make sure data is in a data frame format\ndt <- data.frame(dt)\n\n\n# next we use our trick for creating a formula string, which will reduce our work\nformula_str_prop <-\n  paste(X,\n        \"~\",\n        paste(baseline_vars_reflective_propensity, collapse = \"+\"))\n\n# this shows the exposure variable as predicted by the baseline confounders.\nformula_str_prop\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ~ t0_male+t0_gen_cohort+t0_urban+t0_hours_exercise_coarsen+t0_edu_z+t0_employed_z+t0_nz_dep2018_z+t0_nzsei13_z+t0_partner_z+t0_parent_z+t0_pol_orient_z+t0_agreeableness_z+t0_conscientiousness_z+t0_extraversion_z+t0_honesty_humility_z+t0_openness_z+t0_neuroticism_z+t0_modesty_z+t0_religion_identification_level_z+t0_kessler_latent_anxiety_z+t0_kessler_latent_depression_z\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nFor propensity score analysis, we will try several different approaches.

Of these approaches, entropy balancing provided the best balance. The results indicate an excellent balance across all variables, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold of 0.05 across a range of binary and continuous baseline confounders, including gender, generation cohort, urban_location, exercise hours (coarsened, baseline), education, employment status, depression, anxiety, and various personality traits. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs.\n\n> The effective sample sizes were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 2880, 3927, and 1834, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 1855.89, 3659.59, and 1052.01, respectively.\n\n> The weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2310 to 7.0511) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.5769 to 1.9603). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n> We also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n> We plotted these results using love plots, visually confirming both the balance in the propensity score model using entropy balanced weights, and the imbalance in the model that does not adjust for baseline confounders.\n\n> Overall, these findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, conditional on the measured covariates included in the model.\n\n### Example Summary Maori Propensity scores.\n\nResults:\n\n> The entropy balancing method was also the best performing method that was applied to a subgroup analysis of the Māori population. Similar to the NZ European subgroup analysis, the method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup.\n\n> The effective sample sizes for the Māori subgroup were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 307, 354, and 160, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 220.54, 321.09, and 76.39, respectively\n\n> The weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups in the Māori subgroup varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2213 to 3.8101) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.3995 to 1.9800). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n> The study also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group for the Māori subgroup. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n> In conclusion, the results of the Māori subgroup analysis are consistent with the overall analysis. The entropy balancing method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold.

Yet, the confidence interval for this estimate (-0.114 to 0.188) also crosses zero, indicating similar uncertainties.

This is suggested by the estimated risk difference (RD_m - RD_e) of 0.068. However, there is a degree of uncertainty in this estimate, as the confidence interval (-0.09 to 0.229) crosses zero. This suggests that we cannot be confident that the difference in depression reduction between New Zealand Europeans and Māori is statistically significant. It's possible that the true difference could be zero or even negative, implying a greater depression reduction for Māori than New Zealand Europeans. Thus, while the results hint at a larger depression reduction for New Zealand Europeans, the uncertainty in this estimate urges us to interpret this difference with caution.\n\n\n\n### Discusion \n\nYou'll need to do this yourself. Here's a start: \n\n\n> In our study, we employed a robust statistical method that helps us estimate the impact of exercise on reducing anxiety among different population groups – New Zealand Europeans and Māori. This method has the advantage of providing reliable results even if our underlying assumptions aren't entirely accurate – a likely scenario given the complexity of real-world data.  However, this robustness comes with a trade-off: it gives us wider ranges of uncertainty in our estimates. This doesn't mean the analysis is flawed; rather, it accurately represents our level of certainty given the data we have.\n\n#### **Exercise and Anxiety**\n\n> Our analysis suggests that exercise may have a greater effect in reducing anxiety among New Zealand Europeans compared to Māori. This conclusion comes from our primary causal estimate, the risk difference, which is 0.104. However, it's crucial to consider our uncertainty in this value. We represent this uncertainty as a range, also known as a confidence interval. In this case, the interval ranges from -0.042 to 0.279. What this means is, given our current data and method, the true effect could plausibly be anywhere within this range. While our best estimate shows a higher reduction in anxiety for New Zealand Europeans, the range of plausible values includes zero and even negative values. This implies that the true effect could be no difference between the two groups or even a higher reduction in Māori. Hence, while there's an indication of a difference, we should interpret it cautiously given the wide range of uncertainty.\n\n> Thus, although our analysis points towards a potential difference in how exercise reduces anxiety among these groups, the level of uncertainty means we should be careful about drawing firm conclusions. More research is needed to further explore these patterns.\n\n#### **Exercise and Depression**\n\n\n> In addition to anxiety, we also examined the effect of exercise on depression. We do not find evidence for reduction of depression from exercise in either group. We do not find evidence for the effect of weekly exercise -- as self-reported -- on depression. \n\n#### **Proviso**\n\n> It is important to bear in mind that statistical results are only one piece of a larger scientific puzzle about the relationship between excercise and well-being. Other pieces include understanding the context, incorporating subject matter knowledge, and considering the implications of the findings. In the present study, wide confidence intervals suggest the possibility of considerable individual differences.$\\dots$ nevertheless, $\\dots$\n\n\n**Again, you will need to come up with your own discussion, but follow the step-by-step instructions above as a guide.**\n\n",
