We aim to familiarise you with the software and enable you to simulate and manipulate data from the beginning.\n\n## Installing R\n\n1. Visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).\n2. Select the version of R suitable for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).\n3. Download and install it by following the on-screen instructions.\n\n## Installing RStudio\n\n1. Go to the RStudio download page at [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).\n2. Choose the free version of RStudio Desktop, and download it for your operating system.\n3. Install RStudio by following the provided instructions.\n\n## Familiarizing Yourself with RStudio\n\n- **Console**: Executes R code line by line.\n- **Source Editor**: Allows you to write and execute scripts (series of commands).\n- **Environment**: Displays variables and data you've loaded.\n- **Files/Plots/Packages/Help**: Allows you to navigate your files, view plots, manage packages, and access R documentation.\n\n## Basic R Commands\n\nLet us start by using R as a calculator. This will help you understand how to execute simple commands in the console.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Addition\n3 + 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Subtraction\n5 - 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Multiplication\n3 * 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Division\n10 / 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Modulus\n7 %% 2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Exponentiation\n2 ^ 3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Integer Division\n10 %/% 3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 1: Installing the `tidyverse` Package\n\nIn this exercise, you will install the `tidyverse` package, a collection of R packages designed for data science. Follow the steps below to complete the installation:\n\n1. **Open RStudio:** Start by launching RStudio on your computer.\n\n2. **Access Help Tab:** Locate and click on the \"Help\" tab in the lower right pane of RStudio.\n\n3. **Search for Installation Instructions:** In the search bar within the \"Help\" tab, type in \"install packages\" and press Enter. Browse through the help documents if available. (Note: The specific steps to search within the Help tab might vary based on RStudio version and setup. If you cannot find the option to search for \"install packages\" directly in the Help tab, proceed to the next step.)\n\n4. **Open Package Installation:**\n    - Alternatively, you can directly access the package installation option by going to the \"Tools\" menu at the top of RStudio.\n    - Select \"Install Packages...\" from the dropdown menu.\n\n5. **Install `tidyverse`:**\n    - In the \"Install Packages\" dialogue box, you'll find a field to type in the name of the package you wish to install. Type `tidyverse` into this field.\n    - Ensure the \"Install dependencies\" checkbox is ticked. This option ensures that any additional packages needed by `tidyverse` are also installed.\n\n6. **Begin Installation:**\n    - Click on the \"Install\" button to start the installation process.\n\n7. **Wait for Completion:** The installation might take a few minutes. Monitor the progress in the \"Console\" pane. Once the installation is complete, you will see a message in the console indicating that the process has finished.\n\n8. **Loading `tidyverse`:** After successful installation, you can load the `tidyverse` package into your R session by typing `library(tidyverse)` in the console and pressing Enter.\n\n\n\n## Simulating Data in R\n\nSimulating data is a powerful method to understand statistical concepts and data manipulation. Let's simulate a simple dataset representing scores from two cultural groups.\n\n\n#### Step 1: Setting Up Your R Environment\n\nBefore simulating data, ensure R or RStudio is installed and open. RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for R, which can simplify the process of writing and executing R scripts.\n\n#### Step 2: Setting a Seed for Reproducibility\n\nTo ensure that your simulated data can be reproduced exactly, it's good practice to set a seed before generating random data. This makes your analyses and simulations replicable.\n\n```r\nset.seed(123) # use any number to set the seed\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Simulating Continuous Data\n\nTo simulate continuous data, you can use functions like `rnorm()` for normal distributions, `runif()` for uniform distributions, etc. Here’s how to simulate 100 normally distributed data points with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 100 # number of observations\nmean <- 50\nsd <- 10\ndata_continuous <- rnorm(n, mean, sd)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Step 4: Simulating Categorical Data\n\nCategorical data can be simulated using the `sample()` function. For example, to simulate a binary variable (e.g., gender) with two levels for 100 observations:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlevels <- c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\ndata_categorical <- sample(levels, n, replace = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Step 5: Simulating Data Frames\n\nData frames are used in R to store data tables. To simulate a dataset with both continuous and categorical data, you can combine the above steps:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a data frame with simulated data for ID, Gender, Age, and Income\ndata_frame <- data.frame(\n  # generate a sequence of IDs from 1 to n\n  ID = 1:n,\n  \n  # randomly assign 'Male' or 'Female' to each observation\n  Gender = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  \n  # simulate 'Age' data: normally distributed with mean 30 and sd 5\n  Age = rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 5),\n  \n  # simulate 'Income' data: normally distributed with mean 50000 and sd 10000\n  Income = rnorm(n, mean = 50000, sd = 10000)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that you can sample probabilistically for your groups\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 100 # total number of observations\n\n# sample 'Gender' with a 40/60 proportion for Male/Female\nGender = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.6))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Step 6: Add Complexity\n\nTo simulate more complex datasets, you can introduce relationships between variables. For instance, simulating age and income with a correlation:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set the number of observations\nn <- 100\n\n# simulate the 'Age' variable\nmean_age <- 30\nsd_age <- 5\nAge <- rnorm(n, mean = mean_age, sd = sd_age)\n\n# define coefficients explicitly\nintercept <- 20000   # Intercept for the income equation\nbeta_age <- 1500     # Coefficient for the effect of age on income\nerror_sd <- 10000    # Standard deviation of the error term\n\n# simulate 'Income' based on 'Age' and defined coefficients\nIncome <- intercept + beta_age * Age + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = error_sd)\n\n# create a data frame to hold the simulated data\ndata_complex <- data.frame(Age, Income)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Step 7: Visualising Simulated Data\n\nVisualising your simulated data can help understand its distribution and relationships. Use the `ggplot2` package for this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data_complex, aes(x = Age, y = Income)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Simulated Age vs. Income\", x = \"Age\", y = \"Income\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Practice\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123) #  reproducibility\ngroupA_scores <- rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 15) # simulate scores for group A\ngroupB_scores <- rnorm(100, mean = 105, sd = 15) # simulate scores for group B\n\n# ombine into a data frame\nscores_df <- data.frame(Group = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 100), Scores = c(groupA_scores, groupB_scores))\n\n# commands to view data\nstr(scores_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t200 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ Group : chr  \"A\" \"A\" \"A\" \"A\" ...\n $ Scores: num  91.6 96.5 123.4 101.1 101.9 ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# summary of columns\nsummary(scores_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Group               Scores      \n Length:200         Min.   : 65.36  \n Class :character   1st Qu.: 92.59  \n Mode  :character   Median :101.38  \n                    Mean   :102.37  \n                    3rd Qu.:111.59  \n                    Max.   :153.62  \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# top rows\nhead(scores_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Group    Scores\n1     A  91.59287\n2     A  96.54734\n3     A 123.38062\n4     A 101.05763\n5     A 101.93932\n6     A 125.72597\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# bottom rows\ntail(scores_df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Group    Scores\n195     B  85.33798\n196     B 134.95820\n197     B 114.01063\n198     B  86.23093\n199     B  95.83251\n200     B  87.21780\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Visualising simulated data\n\nUnderstanding your data visually is as important as the statistical analysis itself.

We will return to regression over the next few weeks and use regression to hone your skills in R.

Follow the detailed instructions below to simulate the necessary data, execute the regression, and report your findings:\n\n1. **Simulate Data:**\n   - Generate two continuous variables, `Y` and `A`, with `n = 100` observations each.\n   - The variable `A` should have a mean of `50` and a standard deviation (`sd`) of `10`.\n\n2. **Define the Relationship:**\n   - Simulate the variable `Y` such that it is linearly related to `A` with a specified effect size. The effect size of `A` on `Y` must be explicitly defined as `2`.\n\n3. **Incorporate an Error Term:**\n   - When simulating `Y`, include an error term with a standard deviation (`sd`) of `20` to introduce variability.\n\n4. **Regression Analysis:**\n   - Use the `lm()` function in R to regress `Y` on `A`.\n   - Ensure the regression model captures the specified effect of `A` on `Y`.\n\n5. **Report the Results:**\n   - Output the regression model summary to examine the coefficients, including the effect of `A` on `Y`, and assess the model's overall fit and significance.\n\n\nHere's a template to get you started\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(parameters)\n#  seed for reproducibility\nset.seed( ) # numbers go in brackets\n\n# number of observations\nn <-   # number goes here\n\n# simulate data for variable A with specified mean and sd\nA <- rnorm(n, \n           mean = , # set your number here \n           sd = )# set your number here \n\n# define the specified effect size of A on Y\nbeta_A <-   # define your effect with a number here \n\n\n# simulate data and make data frame in one step\n\ndf_3 <- data.frame(\n  # simulate data for variable A with specified mean and sd\n  A = A, # from above\n  Y = 5 + beta_A * A + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 20) #  effect is intercept + ...\n)\n\n# view\nhead(df_3)\nstr(df_3)\n\n#  linear regression of Y on A\nfit_3 <- lm(Y ~ A, data = df_3)\n\n#  results (standard code)\n# summary(model)\n\n# time saving reports\nparameters::model_parameters(fit_3)\nreport(fit_3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## For more information about the packages used here:\n\n  - [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): A system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.\n\n  - [Parameters package](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/): Provides utilities for processing model parameters and their metrics.\n\n  - [Report package](https://easystats.github.io/report/index.html): Facilitates the automated generation of reports from statistical models.\n\n\n## What You Have Learned\n\n- **How to install and setup R:** \n\nYou've successfully installed R and RStudio, setting up your workstation for statistical analysis.\n  \n- **How to install and use RStudio:** \n\nYou've familiarised yourself with the RStudio interface, including the console, source editor, environment tab, and other utilities for effective data analysis.\n  \n- **Basic R operations:** \n\nYou've practided using R for basic arithmetic operations, understanding how to execute simple commands in the console.\n  \n- **Data simulation:** \n\nYou've learned to simulate datasets in R.

The model explains a statistically not significant and very weak\nproportion of variance (R2 = 1.83e-06, F(1, 98) = 1.79e-04, p = 0.989, adj. R2\n= -0.01). The model's intercept, corresponding to A = 0, is at 109.17 (95% CI\n[80.17, 138.18], t(98) = 7.47, p < .001). Within this model:\n\n  - The effect of A is statistically non-significant and negative (beta =\n-3.80e-03, 95% CI [-0.57, 0.56], t(98) = -0.01, p = 0.989; Std. beta =\n-1.35e-03, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.20])\n\nStandardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized\nversion of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were\ncomputed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Appendix B: I lied\n\nWe can get group comparisons with ANOVA, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Conduct Tukey's HSD test for post-hoc comparisons\ntukey_post_hoc <- TukeyHSD(anova_model)\n\n# Display the results\nprint(tukey_post_hoc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = y ~ group, data = df_1)\n\n$group\n           diff        lwr        upr     p adj\n2-1  -0.8030143  -9.560281   7.954253 0.9739971\n3-1 117.6732276 108.915961 126.430495 0.0000000\n3-2 118.4762419 109.718975 127.233509 0.0000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(tukey_post_hoc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRegression and ANOVA are equivalent\n\n\n\n",
