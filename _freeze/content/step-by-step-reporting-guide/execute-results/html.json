If not, state it.\n-   Relevance of the Question: Have I explained its importance? If not, explain.\n-   Subgroup Analysis: Does my question involve a subgroup (e.g., cultural group)? If not, develop a subgroup analysis question.\n-   Causality of the Question: Is my question causal? Briefly explain what this means with reference to the potential outcomes framework.\n-   State how you will use time-series data to address causality.\n-   Define your exposure.\n-   Define your outcome(s)\n-   Explain how the the exposure and outcome is relevant to your question.\n-   Define your causal estimand (see: lecture 8). Hint: it is ATE_g\\_risk difference = E\\[Y(1)-(0)\\|G,L\\], where G is your multiple-group indicator and L is your set of baseline confounders.\n\n## Method\n-   Consider any ethical implications.\n-   Explain the sample. Provide descriptive statistics\n-   Discuss inclusion criteria.\n-   Discuss how your sample relates to the \"source population\" (lecture 8.)\n-   Explain NZAVS measures. State the questions used in the items\n-   In your own words describe how the data meet the following assumptions required for causal inference:\n-   Positivity: Can we intervene on the exposure at all levels of the covariates? Use the code I provided to test whether there is change in the exposure from the baseline in the source population(s)\n-   Consistency: Can I interpret what it means to intervene on the exposure?\n-   Exchangeability: Are different versions of the exposure conditionally exchangeable given measured baseline confounders? This requires stating baseline confounders and explaining how they may be related to both the exposure and outcome. As part of this, **you must explain why the baseline measure of your exposure and outcome are included as potential confounders.**\n-   Note: Unmeasured Confounders: Does previous science suggest the presence of unmeasured confounders? (e.g. childhood exposures that are not measured).\n-   Draw a causal diagram: Have I drawn a causal diagram (DAG) to highlight both measured and unmeasured sources of confounding?\n-   Measurement Error: Have I described potential biases from measurement errors? Return to lecture 11.\n-   State how you will handle missing data\n-   State what your estimator will be. Note I've given you the following text to modify:\n\n> The Doubly Robust Estimation method for Subgroup Analysis Estimator is a sophisticated tool combining features of both IPTW and G-computation methods, providing unbiased estimates if either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. The process involves five main steps:\n\n> Step 1 involves the estimation of the propensity score, a measure of the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates and the subgroup indicator. This score is calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, with the model choice depending on the nature of the data and exposure. Weights for each individual are then calculated using this propensity score. These weights depend on the exposure status and are computed differently for exposed and unexposed individuals. The estimation of propensity scores is performed separately within each subgroup stratum.\n\n> Step 2 focuses on fitting a weighted outcome model, making use of the previously calculated weights from the propensity scores. This model estimates the outcome conditional on exposure, covariates, and subgroup, integrating the weights into the estimation process. Unlike in propensity score model estimation, covariates are included as variables in the outcome model. This inclusion makes the method doubly robust - providing a consistent effect estimate if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified, thereby reducing the assumption of correct model specification.\n\n> Step 3 entails the simulation of potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup. These hypothetical scenarios assume universal exposure to the intervention within each subgroup, regardless of actual exposure levels. The expectation of potential outcomes is calculated for each individual in each subgroup, using individual-specific weights. These scenarios are performed for both the current and alternative interventions.\n\n> Step 4 is the estimation of the average causal effect for each subgroup, achieved by comparing the computed expected values of potential outcomes under each intervention level. The difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure within each subgroup.\n\n> Step 5 involves comparing differences in causal effects across groups by calculating the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups. Confidence intervals and standard errors for these calculations are determined using simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023). This step allows for a comprehensive comparison of the impact of different interventions across various subgroups, while encorporating uncertainty.\n\n\nOR if you decide to use machine learning: \n\n> We perform statistical estimation using semi-parametric Targeted Learning, specifically a Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE) estimator. TMLE is a robust method that combines machine learning techniques with traditional statistical models to estimate causal effects while providing valid statistical uncertainty measures for these estimates [@van2014targeted; @van2012targeted].\n\n> TMLE operates through a two-step process that involves modelling both the outcome and treatment (exposure). Initially, TMLE employs machine learning algorithms to flexibly model the relationship between treatments, covariates, and outcomes. This flexibility allows TMLE to account for complex, high-dimensional covariate spaces efficiently without imposing restrictive model assumptions [@van2014discussion; @vanderlaan2011; @vanderlaan2018]. The outcome of this step is a set of initial estimates for these relationships.\n\n> The second step of TMLE involves \"targeting\" these initial estimates by incorporating information about the observed data distribution to improve the accuracy of the causal effect estimate. TMLE achieves this precision through an iterative updating process, which adjusts the initial estimates towards the true causal effect. This updating process is guided by the efficient influence function, ensuring that the final TMLE estimate is as close as possible, given the measures and data, to the targeted causal effect while still being robust to model-misspecification in either the outcome or the treatment model [@van2014discussion].\n\n> Again, a central feature of TMLE is its double-robustness property. If either the treatment model or the outcome model is correctly specified, the TMLE estimator will consistently estimate the causal effect. Additionally, we used cross-validation to avoid over-fitting, following the pre-stated protocols in @bulbulia2024PRACTICAL.  The integration of TMLE and machine learning technologies reduces the dependence on restrictive modelling assumptions and introduces an additional layer of robustness. For further details of the specific targeted learning strategy we favour, see [@hoffman2022; @hoffman2023; @díaz2021]. We perform estimation using the `lmtp` package [@williams2021]. We used the `superlearner` library for semi-parametric estimation with the predefined libraries `SL.ranger`, `SL.glmnet`, and `SL.xgboost` [@polley2023; @xgboost2023; @Ranger2017]. We created graphs, tables and output reports using the `margot` package [@margot2024]. \n\n\n\n<!-- Also see the appendix [here](https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-434-2023/content/09-content.html#comprehensive-checklist-for-detailed-reporting-of-a-causal-inferenctial-study-e.g.-assessment-3-option-2) -->\n\n\n\n\n-   State what E-values are (lecture 9) and how you will use Evalues to clarify the risk of unmeasured confounding.\n\n\n\n## Results\n\n-   Use the scripts I have provided as a template for your analysis.\n-   Propensity Score Reporting: Detail the process of propensity score derivation, including the model used and any variable transformations: e.g.: `A ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + ....` using logistic regression, all continuous predictors were transformed to z-scores\n    -   WeightIt Package Utilisation: Explicitly mention the use of the 'WeightIt' package in R, including any specific options or parameters used in the propensity score estimation process [@greifer2023a].\n    -   Report if different methods were used to obtain propensity scores, and the reasons behind the choice of methods such as 'ebal', 'energy', and 'ps'.\n    -   If your exposure is continuous only the 'energy' option was used for propensity score estimation.\n    -   Subgroup Estimation: Confirm that the propensity scores for subgroups were estimated separately, and discuss how the weights were subsequently combined with the original data.\n    -   Covariate Balance: Include a Love plot to visually represent covariate balance on the exposure both before and after weighting. The script will generate these plots.\n    -   Weighting Algorithm Statistics: Report the statistics for the weighting algorithms as provided by the WeightIt package, including any measures of balance or fit. The script I gave you will generate this information\n\nExample:\n\n> We estimated propensity scores by fitting a model for the exposure A as it is predicted by the set of baseline covariates defined by L. Because we are interested in effect modification by group, we fit different propensity score models for within strata of G using the `subgroup` command of the `WeightIt` package. Thus the propensity score is the the probability of receiving a value of a treatment (A=a) conditional on the covariates L, and stratum within G. We compared balance using the following methods of weighting: \"ebal\" or entropy balancing, \"energy\" or energy balancing, and \"ps\" or traditional inverse probability of weighting balancing. Of these methods \"ebal\" performed the best. Table X and Figure Y present the results of the ebalancing method.\n\n-   Interpretation of Propensity Scores: we interpret the proposensity scores as yeilding good balance across the exposure conditions.\n\n-   Outcome Regression Model: Clearly report the type of regression model used to estimate outcome model coefficients (e.g., linear regression, Poisson, binomial), and mention if the exposure was interacted with the baseline covariates. Do not report model coefficients as these have no interpretation. Example\n\n> We fit a linear model using maximum likelihood estimation with the outcome Y predicted by the exposure A. We interacted the exposure with all baseline confounders L. Continuous baseline confounders were converted to z-scores, whereas categorical exposures were not. Also interacted with all baseline confounders was a term for the subgroup, which was also interacted with the exposure and baseline covariates. This allowed uas to flexibily fit non-linearities for the modification of the effect of the exposure within levels of the cultural group strata of interest. We note that model coefficients have no interpretation in this context so are not reported. The remaining steps of Doubly-Robust estimation were performed as outlined in the *Method* section. We calculated confidence intervals and standard errors, using the `clarify` package in R, which relies on simulation based inference for these quantities of interest [@greifer2023]\n\n-   Report the causal estimates.\n    -   ATE contrasts for groups in setting the exposure to for each group in setting level A = a and A = a\\*\n    -   differences between groups in the magnitude of the effects. (ATE_group 1 - ATE_group_2)\n-   Report the E-value: how sensitive are your results to unmeasured confounding? Hint: see the code below. I've substantially automated this task.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nMake sure to hit these points:\n\nConsider the following ideas about what to discuss in one's findings. The order of exposition might be different.\n\n1.  **Summary of results**: What did you find?\n\n2.  **Interpretation of E-values:** Interpret the E-values used for sensitivity analysis. State what they represent in terms of the robustness of the findings to potential unmeasured confounding.\n\n3.  **Causal Effect Interpretation:** What is the interest of the effect, if any, if an effect was observed? Interpret the average causal effect of changing the exposure level within each subgroup, and discuss its relevance to the research question.\n\n4.  **Comparison of Subgroups:** Discuss how differences in causal effect estimates between different subgroups, if observed, or if not observed, contribute to the overall findings of the study.\n\n5.  **Uncertainty and Confidence Intervals:** Consider the uncertainty around the estimated causal effects, and interpret the confidence intervals to understand the precision of the estimates.\n\n6.  **Generalisability and Transportability:** Reflect on the generalizability of the study results to other contexts or populations. Discuss any factors that might influence the transportability of the causal effects found in the study. (Again see lecture 9.)\n\n7.  **Assumptions and Limitations:** Reflect on the assumptions made during the study and identify any limitations in the methodology that could affect the interpretation of results. State that the implications of different intervention levels on potential outcomes are not analysed.\n\n8.  **Theoretical Relevance**: How are these findings relevant to existing theories.\n\n9.  **Replication and Future Research:** Consider how the study could be replicated or expanded upon in future research, and how the findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field.\n\n10. **Real-world Implications:** Discuss the real-world implications of the findings, and how they could be applied in policy, practice, or further research.\n\n## Example anlaysis (week 10)\n\n## Load Libraries\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Before running this source code, make sure to update to the current version of R, and to update all existing packages.\n\n# functions\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-bayes/templates/main/functions/funs.R\")\n\n\n# # experimental functions (more functions)\n# source(\n#   \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-bayes/templates/main/functions/experimental_funs.R\"\n# )\n\n\n#  If you haven't already, you should have created a folder called \"data\", in your Rstudio project.

Of these approaches, entropy balancing provided the best balance. The results indicate an excellent balance across all variables, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold of 0.05 across a range of binary and continuous baseline confounders, including gender, generation cohort, urban_location, exercise hours (coarsened, baseline), education, employment status, depression, anxiety, and various personality traits. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs. -->\n\n<!-- > The effective sample sizes were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 2880, 3927, and 1834, respectively.

Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights. -->\n\n<!-- > We also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights. -->\n\n<!-- > We plotted these results using love plots, visually confirming both the balance in the propensity score model using entropy balanced weights, and the imbalance in the model that does not adjust for baseline confounders. -->\n\n<!-- > Overall, these findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, conditional on the measured covariates included in the model. -->\n\n<!-- ### Example Summary Maori Propensity scores. -->\n\n<!-- Results: -->\n\n<!-- > The entropy balancing method was also the best performing method that was applied to a subgroup analysis of the Māori population. Similar to the NZ European subgroup analysis, the method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup. -->\n\n<!-- > The effective sample sizes for the Māori subgroup were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 307, 354, and 160, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 220.54, 321.09, and 76.39, respectively -->\n\n<!-- > The weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups in the Māori subgroup varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2213 to 3.8101) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.3995 to 1.9800). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights. -->\n\n<!-- > The study also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group for the Māori subgroup. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights. -->\n\n<!-- > In conclusion, the results of the Māori subgroup analysis are consistent with the overall analysis. The entropy balancing method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold. These findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, even in subgroup analyses. -->\n\n<!-- ### More data wrangling, again, this time for the weights on the continuous exposure -->\n\n<!-- Note that we need to attach the `weights` from the propensity score model back to the data. -->\n\n<!-- However, because our weighting analysis estimates a model for the *exposure*, we only need to do this analysis once, no matter how many outcomes we investigate.

Thus, while the results hint at a larger depression reduction for New Zealand Europeans, the uncertainty in this estimate urges us to interpret this difference with caution. -->\n\n\n\n<!-- ### Discusion  -->\n\n<!-- You'll need to write the discussion for yourself. Here's a start:  -->\n\n\n<!-- > In our study, we employed a robust statistical method that helps us estimate the impact of exercise on reducing anxiety among different population groups – New Zealand Europeans and Māori. This method has the advantage of providing reliable results even if our underlying assumptions aren't entirely accurate – a likely scenario given the complexity of real-world data.  However, this robustness comes with a trade-off: it gives us wider ranges of uncertainty in our estimates. This doesn't mean the analysis is flawed; rather, it accurately represents our level of certainty given the data we have. -->\n\n<!-- #### **Exercise and anxiety** -->\n\n<!-- > Our analysis suggests that exercise may have a greater effect in reducing anxiety among New Zealand Europeans compared to Māori. This conclusion comes from our primary causal estimate, the risk difference, which is 0.104. However, it's crucial to consider our uncertainty in this value. We represent this uncertainty as a range, also known as a confidence interval. In this case, the interval ranges from -0.042 to 0.279. What this means is, given our current data and method, the true effect could plausibly be anywhere within this range. While our best estimate shows a higher reduction in anxiety for New Zealand Europeans, the range of plausible values includes zero and even negative values. This implies that the true effect could be no difference between the two groups or even a higher reduction in Māori. Hence, while there is an indication of a difference, we should interpret it cautiously given the wide range of uncertainty. -->\n\n<!-- > Thus, although our analysis points towards a potential difference in how exercise reduces anxiety among these groups, the level of uncertainty means we should be careful about drawing firm conclusions. More research is needed to further explore these patterns. -->\n\n<!-- #### **Exercise and depression** -->\n\n\n<!-- > In addition to anxiety, we also examined the effect of exercise on depression. We do not find evidence for reduction of depression from exercise in either group. We do not find evidence for the effect of weekly exercise -- as self-reported -- on depression.  -->\n\n<!-- #### **Limitations** -->\n\n<!-- > It is important to bear in mind that statistical results are only one piece of a larger scientific puzzle about the relationship between excercise and well-being. Other pieces include understanding the context, incorporating subject matter knowledge, and considering the implications of the findings. In the present study, wide confidence intervals suggest the possibility of considerable individual differences.$\\dots$ nevertheless, $\\dots$ -->\n\n\n<!-- **Again, you will need to come up with your own discussion, but you may follow the step-by-step instructions above as a guide.** -->\n\n\n<!-- ## Appendix: Continuous Exposure -->\n\n\n<!-- ### Check positivity in continuous variable  -->\n\n<!-- Note we are using the natural log of exercise because the variable is highly dispersed.

However, the log-transformed hours of exercise, `t0_hours_exercise_log_z`, had a Corr.Adj of 0.0515, just surpassing our target threshold of 0.05. This suggests a slightly reduced level of balance for this particular variable compared to others. -->\n\n<!-- > The total unadjusted sample size was 821, and after energy balancing adjustment, the effective sample size was reduced to 647.62. The reduction in sample size is attributed to the application of weights to the observations, aiming to minimize imbalance across the exposure groups. -->\n\n<!-- > The range of weights, as reported in the summary of weights, varied from 0 to 2.8893. Despite the relatively wide range, the weight statistics demonstrate that the balance of weights is acceptable. The coefficient of variation was 0.518, the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) was 0.407, and entropy was 0.15, all indicating an acceptable balance of weights across the samples. -->\n\n<!-- > We also identified the five units with the most extreme weights. These units possessed higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups. However, these extreme weights did not significantly disrupt the overall balance. -->\n\n<!-- > The total unweighted sample size was 821, while the weighted sample size, after the application of energy balancing, was 647.62. -->\n\n<!-- > We infer that energy balancing procedure applied to estimate propensity scores for the continuous exposure variable `t1_hours_exercise_log_z` within the Maori subgroup resulted in an acceptable level of balance across most covariates. The energy balancing approach effectively reduces bias and ensured a balanced distribution of covariates across exposure groups, reaffirming its utility in propensity score analysis for continuous exposure variables. However, for the variable `t0_hours_exercise_log_z`, some attention may be needed due to a Corr.Adj value slightly exceeding the usual threshold. -->\n\n<!-- ### More data wrangling -->\n\n<!-- Note that we need to attach the `weights` from the propensity score model back to the data. -->\n\n<!-- However, because our weighting analysis estimates a model for the *exposure*, we only need to do this analysis once, no matter how many outcomes we investigate.
