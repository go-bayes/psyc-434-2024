A joint intervention causal interaction implies that the effect of $A$ and $B$ together on $Y$ (denoted as $Y(A,B)$) is not merely the sum of their individual effects. \n\nFor instance, consider the effect of beliefs in Big Gods (exposure $A$)\non social complexity (outcome $Y$), potentially influenced by a\nculture's monumental architecture (exposure $B$). To assess the\nindividual and combined effects of $A$ and $B$, we look for evidence of\ncausal interaction on the difference scale. Evidence for interaction\nwould be present if the following inequality were to hold:\n\n$$\\bigg(\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)]}_{\\text{joint exposure}} - \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]}_{\\text{neither exposed}}\\bigg) - \\bigg[ \\bigg(\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)]}_{\\text{only A exposed}} - \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]}_{\\text{neither exposed}}\\bigg) + \\bigg(\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)]}_{\\text{only B exposed}} - \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]}_{\\text{neither exposed}} \\bigg)\\bigg] \\neq 0 $$\n\nThis equation simplifies to\n\n$$ \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)]}_{\\text{joint exposure}} - \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)]}_{\\text{only A exposed}} - \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)]}_{\\text{only B exposed}} + \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]}_{\\text{neither exposed}} \\neq 0 $$\n\nA positive value would indicate evidence for additive interaction. A\nnegative value would indicate evidence for sub-additive interaction. A\nvalue near zero would imply no reliable evidence for interaction.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![This diagram presents the individual and joint effects of two exposures, A and B, on outcome Y. We assume that A and B are causally independent. If either exposure affects the other, then we may conduct effect-modification analysis or mediation analysis, but we should avoid causal interaction analysis. The diagram includes confounders L and W. Control for these confounders is necessary to close the backdoor paths that relate each exposure, A and B, to the outcome. Each exposure has equal status in our model: Y(a,b) = Y(b,a). The red path denotes paths of confounding.](07-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-interaction-1.png){#fig-dag-interaction width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-dag-interaction clarifies the need to evaluate two sources of counfounding, one for each intervention ($A$ and $B$). The graph resembles others we have considered. By adjusting for $L_{0}$ we obtain an unbiased estimate of the $A\\to Y$ path. By adjusting for $W_{0}$ we obtain an unbiased estimate of the $B\\to Y$ path. As indicated in @fig-dag-interaction-solved, we  must condition on both $L_{0}$ and $W_{0}$ to identify causal interaction conceived as a joint interaction. \n\nAn important complication is that evidence for causal interaction may differ depending on the measurement scale one chooses to assess it [@vanderweele2014,@vanderweele2012]. Evidence for the strength of a causal effect estimate for interaction in the presence of effect-modification will differ depending on whether the effect is measured on the ratio scale as opposed to the difference scale (see: @vanderweele2014, who recommends using the causal difference scale for most policy settings.)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![We adjust for confounding in causal interaction analysis by adjusting for all confounders of the A to Y path as well as all for the B to Y path.

Doing so better clarifies demands for data quality -- the timing of the events must be ensured. Data collection should also draw on expert knowledge about how $A$ and $B$ may be related over time; measurements of $A$ and $B$ should be taken within intervals in which $A$ and $B$ are unlikely to affect each other.\n\n#### 3.1.4 Interaction as effect-modification of a single intervention\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A simple sequentially ordered graph depicting effect-modification. We are interested in G as an effect-modifier of A on Y. A must not affect G (although G may affect A, we do not suppose such an effect). The blue path indicates effect-modification of A by G. The red path indicates an open backdoor path. We draw a box around G to indicate that we are conditioning on G in our model. We are interested in estimating the effect of A on Y. We must close all backdoor paths between A and Y, in this case, by conditioning on L. We are not interested in the effect of double intervention of G and A. Hence, we do not need to condition on Z to close the backdoor path from G to Y.](07-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-effect-modification-1.png){#fig-dag-effect-modification width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt is often scientifically interesting to consider whether treatment effects vary over levels of other variable without imagining a double intervention. We call a variable over which the treatment effect varies, an 'effect-modifier' or an 'effect-measure modifier.' We call the phenomenon of variation in the effect of the exposure over levels of a covariate, 'effect-modification,' or 'effect-measure modification' or 'treatment effect heterogeneity. The counterfactual contrasts required to estimate effect-modification differ from those of a joint intervention. Suppose $A$ is the treatment, $G$ is the modifier, and $Y$ is the outcome. effect-modification assesses whether the effect of $A$ on $Y$ is different across levels of $G$ (i.e., whether the effect of $A$ on $Y$ is different when $G = g1$ compared to when $G = g2$).\n\n@fig-dag-effect-modification consider whether effect-modification of $A$ on $Y$ across levels of $G$. Because we are not interested in the causal effect of $G$ as such, but rather, how the effect of $A$ varies across $G$, we would not need to adjust $G$ by $Z$. However, as we shall consider in the next section, the presence and absence of effect-modification may depend on other variables in a causal network, as well as on which other variables investigators condition on in their models. To foreshadow, we suppose that $Z$, a parent of $G$, is an effect-modifier of $A$ on $Y$. Were we to include $Z$ in the model, the effect estimate for $G$ on $Y$ may be attenuated or erased. There is here no clear fact of the matter about whether and how much $G$ is an effect-modifier outside of researcher modelling decisions. I remind readers: *with absolute power comes absolute responsibility.*\n\nTo better understand the interest of effect-modification, again consider a study investigating whether beliefs in big Gods affect social complexity. Suppose we compare two distinct geographical groups: North American societies ($G=1$) and Continental societies ($G=2$). Suppose we want to examine the causal effect of changing the exposure from $A = 0$ to $A = 1$ within each group and then compare these effects across the groups. The relevant causal contrasts are given as follows:\n\n1.  **Causal effect within North American societies (**$G=1$):\n    $$\\hat{\\tau}_{g1} = \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[Y(1)|G=1] - \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[Y(0)|G=1]$$ \n    \nHere, $\\hat{\\tau}_{g1}$ represents the estimated causal effect of changing the exposure from $A = 0$ to $A = 1$ within the North American societies.\n\n2.  **Causal effect within Continental societies (**$G=2$):\n\n    $$\\hat{\\tau}_{g2} = \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[Y(1)|G=2] - \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[Y(0)|G=2]$$\n\n    Similarly, $\\hat{\\tau}_{g2}$ denotes the estimated causal effect for the Continental societies.\n\n3.  **Comparing causal effects across groups**:\n\n    $$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{\\tau}_{g1} - \\hat{\\tau}_{g2}$$ \n    \nThe estimated quantity $\\hat{\\gamma}$ computes the difference in the causal estimands between the two groups. A nonzero $\\hat{\\gamma}$ indicates effect-modification, suggesting that the effect of changing the exposure differs between the two groups. If we were to observe that $\\hat{\\gamma} \\neq 0$, this would provide evidence for variability in the effect of the exposure on the outcome in different groups. Note that the causal effect for one group might be indistinguishable from zero, and yet we might nevertheless find evidence for effect-modification if the comparison group exhibits reliably different responses from the contrast group that is indistinguishable from zero.\n\n#### 3.1.5 Evidence for effect-modification is relative to inclusion of other variables in the model\n\nThe 'sharp-null hypothesis' states there is no effect of the exposure on\nthe outcome for any unit in the target population. Unless the 'sharp-null hypothesis' is false, there may be effect-modification. For any study worth conducting, we cannot evaluate whether the sharp-null hypothesis is false. If we could the experiment would be otiose. Therefore, we must assume the possibility of effect-modification. Notably, whether a variable is an effect-modifier also depends on which other variables are included in the model. That is, just as for the concept of a 'confounder', where a variable is an 'effect-modifier' cannot be stated without reference to an assumed causal order and an explicit statement about which other variables will be included in the model [@vanderweele2012].\n\n@fig-eff-mod-rel presents a scenario in which the marginal association\nbetween $A$ and $Y$ is unbiased. The exposure $A$ is unconditionally\nassociated with $Y$. Recall our convention $\\boxedblue{G}$ denotes\neffect-modification with conditioning and $\\circleblue{Z}$ indicates\neffect-modification without conditioning. This graph states that the\nconditional association of $A$ on $Y$ varies within levels of\n$\\boxedblue{G}$ (which is conditioned on), and furthermore that $G$ is\nan *effect-modifier by proxy* [@vanderweele2009distinction]. Here,\n$\\circleblue{Z}$ fully mediates the association of $G$ and $Y$. That is\n$\\circleblue{Z}$ causes both $G$ and $Y$, and $G$ has no causal effect\non $Y$.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Consider a randomised experiment. There is no confounding. Here, the marginal association between A and Y provides an unbiased estimate for the causal effect of A on Y. Does the conditional association of A on Y vary within levels of G? The causal diagram allows for a classification of G as an effect modifier of A on Y by proxy. G modifies A's effect on Y in virtue of G's relationship to Z, which, according to this graph, is a direct effect modifier for the effect of A on Y.](07-content_files/figure-html/fig-eff-mod-rel-1.png){#fig-eff-mod-rel width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-dag-effect-modification-4 presents the same a randomised experiment\nas in the previous causal diagram. We again assume that there is no\nconfounding of the marginal association between the exposure, $A$, and\nthe outcome, $Y$. However, suppose we were to adjust for $Z$ and ask,\ndoes the conditional association of $A$ on $Y$ vary within levels of\n$G$, after adjusting for $Z$? That is, does $G$ remain an\neffect-modifier of the exposure on the outcome? @vanderweele2007 proved\nthat for effect-modification to occur, at least one other arrow besides\nthe treatment must enter into the outcome. According to\n@fig-dag-effect-modification-4, the only arrow into $Y$ other than $A$\narrives from $Z$. Because $Y$ is independent of $G$ conditional on $Z$\nwe may infer that $G$ is no longer an effect modifier for the effect of\n$A$ on $Y$. Viewed another way, $G$ no longer co-varies with $Y$\nconditional on $Z$ and so cannot act as an effect-modifier.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Conditioning on Z renders G independent of Y. G is no longer an effect modifier after conditioning on Z because G is independent of Y. Although Z is an unconditional effect modifier, G is not.](07-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-effect-modification-4-1.png){#fig-dag-effect-modification-4 width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-dag-effect-modification-5 presents the same a randomised experiment\nas in the previous graph. If we do not condition on $B$, then $G$ will\nnot modify the effect of $A$ on $Y$ because $G$ will not be associated\nwith $Y$. However, if we were to condition on $B$, then both $B$ (an\neffect modifier by proxy) and $G$ may become effect-modifiers for the\ncausal effect of $A$ on $Y$. In this setting, both $B$ and $G$ are\nconditional effect-modifiers.\n\nNote that casual graphs help us to evaluate classifications of\nconditional and unconditional effect modifiers. They may also help to\nclarify conditions in which conditioning on unconditional\neffect-modifiers may remove conditional effect-modification. However we\ncannot not tell from a causal diagram whether the ancestors of an\nunconditional effect-modifier will be conditional effect-modifiers for\nthe effect of the exposure on the outcome; see: @vanderweele2007, also\n@suzuki2013counterfactual. Causal diagrams express non-parametric\nrelations. I have adopted an off-label colouring convention to denote\ninstances of effect-modification to highlight possible pathways for\neffect-modification, which may be relative to other variables in a\nmodel.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Blue path denotes effect-modification for G by conditioning on B.

If investigators do not condition on $B$, then $G$\ncannot be a conditional effect-modifier because $G$ would then be\nindependent of $Z$ because $B$ is a collider. However, as we observed in\n@fig-dag-effect-modification-5, conditioning on $B$, a collider, may\nopen a path for effect-modification of $G$ by $Z$.
