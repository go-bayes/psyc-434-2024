If not, state it.\n-   Relevance of the Question: Have I explained its importance? If not, explain.\n-   Subgroup Analysis: Does my question involve a subgroup (e.g., cultural group)? If not, develop a subgroup analysis question.\n-   Causality of the Question: Is my question causal? Briefly explain what this means with reference to the potential outcomes framework.\n-   State how you will use time-series data to address causality.\n-   Define your exposure.\n-   Define your outcome(s)\n-   Explain how the the exposure and outcome is relevant to your question.\n-   Define your causal estimand (see: lecture 9). Hint: it is ATE_g\\_risk difference = E\\[Y(1)-(0)\\|G,L\\], where G is your multiple-group indicator and L is your set of baseline confounders.\n\n## Method\n\n-   Consider any ethical implications.\n-   Explain the sample. Provide descriptive statistics\n-   Discuss inclusion criteria.\n-   Discuss how your sample relates to the \"source population\" (lecture 9.)\n-   Explain NZAVS measures. State the questions used in the items\n-   In your own words describe how the data meet the following assumptions required for causal inference:\n-   Positivity: Can we intervene on the exposure at all levels of the covariates? Use the code I provided to test whether there is change in the exposure from the baseline in the source population(s)\n-   Consistency: Can I interpret what it means to intervene on the exposure?\n-   Exchangeability: Are different versions of the exposure conditionally exchangeable given measured baseline confounders? This requires stating baseline confounders and explaining how they may be related to both the exposure and outcome. As part of this, **you must explain why the baseline measure of your exposure and outcome are included as potential confounders.**\n-   Note: Unmeasured Confounders: Does previous science suggest the presence of unmeasured confounders? (e.g. childhood exposures that are not measured).\n-   Draw a causal diagram: Have I drawn a causal diagram (DAG) to highlight both measured and unmeasured sources of confounding?\n-   Measurement Error: Have I described potential biases from measurement errors? Return to lecture 11.\n-   State that you do not have missing data in this synthetic dataset, but that ordinarily missing data would need to be handled.\n-   State what your estimator will be. Note I've given you the following text to modify:\n\n> The Doubly Robust Estimation method for Subgroup Analysis Estimator is a sophisticated tool combining features of both IPTW and G-computation methods, providing unbiased estimates if either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. The process involves five main steps:\n\n> Step 1 involves the estimation of the propensity score, a measure of the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates and the subgroup indicator. This score is calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, with the model choice depending on the nature of the data and exposure. Weights for each individual are then calculated using this propensity score. These weights depend on the exposure status and are computed differently for exposed and unexposed individuals. The estimation of propensity scores is performed separately within each subgroup stratum.\n\n> Step 2 focuses on fitting a weighted outcome model, making use of the previously calculated weights from the propensity scores. This model estimates the outcome conditional on exposure, covariates, and subgroup, integrating the weights into the estimation process. Unlike in propensity score model estimation, covariates are included as variables in the outcome model. This inclusion makes the method doubly robust - providing a consistent effect estimate if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified, thereby reducing the assumption of correct model specification.\n\n> Step 3 entails the simulation of potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup. These hypothetical scenarios assume universal exposure to the intervention within each subgroup, regardless of actual exposure levels. The expectation of potential outcomes is calculated for each individual in each subgroup, using individual-specific weights. These scenarios are performed for both the current and alternative interventions.\n\n> Step 4 is the estimation of the average causal effect for each subgroup, achieved by comparing the computed expected values of potential outcomes under each intervention level. The difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure within each subgroup.\n\n> Step 5 involves comparing differences in causal effects across groups by calculating the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups. Confidence intervals and standard errors for these calculations are determined using simulation-based inference methods (Greifer et al. 2023). This step allows for a comprehensive comparison of the impact of different interventions across various subgroups, while encorporating uncertainty.\n\nAlso see the appendix [here](https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-434-2023/content/09-content.html#comprehensive-checklist-for-detailed-reporting-of-a-causal-inferenctial-study-e.g.-assessment-3-option-2)\n\n-   State what E-values are and how you will use them to clarify the risk of unmeasured confounding.\n\n## Results\n\n-   Use the scripts I have provided as a template for your analysis.\n-   Propensity Score Reporting: Detail the process of propensity score derivation, including the model used and any variable transformations: e.g.: `A ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + ....` using logistic regression, all continuous predictors were transformed to z-scores\n    -   WeightIt Package Utilisation: Explicitly mention the use of the 'WeightIt' package in R, including any specific options or parameters used in the propensity score estimation process [@greifer2023a].\n    -   Report if different methods were used to obtain propensity scores, and the reasons behind the choice of methods such as 'ebal', 'energy', and 'ps'.\n    -   If your exposure is continuous only the 'energy' option was used for propensity score estimation.\n    -   Subgroup Estimation: Confirm that the propensity scores for subgroups were estimated separately, and discuss how the weights were subsequently combined with the original data.\n    -   Covariate Balance: Include a Love plot to visually represent covariate balance on the exposure both before and after weighting. The script will generate these plots.\n    -   Weighting Algorithm Statistics: Report the statistics for the weighting algorithms as provided by the WeightIt package, including any measures of balance or fit. The script I gave you will generate this information\n\nExample:\n\n> We estimated propensity scores by fitting a model for the exposure A as it is predicted by the set of baseline covariates defined by L. Because we are interested in effect modification by group, we fit different propensity score models for within strata of G using the `subgroup` command of the `WeightIt` package. Thus the propensity score is the the probability of receiving a value of a treatment (A=a) conditional on the covariates L, and stratum within G. We compared balance using the following methods of weighting: \"ebal\" or entropy balancing, \"energy\" or energy balancing, and \"ps\" or traditional inverse probability of weighting balancing. Of these methods \"ebal\" performed the best. Table X and Figure Y present the results of the ebalancing method.\n\n-   Interpretation of Propensity Scores: we interpret the proposensity scores as yeilding good balance across the exposure conditions.\n\n-   Outcome Regression Model: Clearly report the type of regression model used to estimate outcome model coefficients (e.g., linear regression, Poisson, binomial), and mention if the exposure was interacted with the baseline covariates. Do not report model coefficients as these have no interpretation. Example\n\n> We fit a linear model using maximum likelihood estimation with the outcome Y predicted by the exposure A. We interacted the exposure with all baseline confounders L. Continuous baseline confounders were converted to z-scores, whereas categorical exposures were not. Also interacted with all baseline confounders was a term for the subgroup, which was also interacted with the exposure and baseline covariates. This allowed uas to flexibily fit non-linearities for the modification of the effect of the exposure within levels of the cultural group strata of interest. We note that model coefficients have no interpretation in this context so are not reported. The remaining steps of Doubly-Robust estimation were performed as outlined in the *Method* section. We calculated confidence intervals and standard errors, using the `clarify` package in R, which relies on simulation based inference for these quantities of interest [@greifer2023]\n\n-   Report the causal estimates.\n    -   ATE contrasts for groups in setting the exposure to for each group in setting level A = a and A = a\\*\n    -   differences between groups in the magnitude of the effects. (ATE_group 1 - ATE_group_2)\n-   Report the E-value: how sensitive are your results to unmeasured confounding? Hint: see the code below. I've substantially automated this task.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nMake sure to hit these points:\n\nConsider the following ideas about what to discuss in one's findings. The order of exposition might be different.\n\n1.  **Summary of results**: What did you find?\n\n2.  **Interpretation of E-values:** Interpret the E-values used for sensitivity analysis. State what they represent in terms of the robustness of the findings to potential unmeasured confounding.\n\n3.  **Causal Effect Interpretation:** What is the interest of the effect, if any, if an effect was observed? Interpret the average causal effect of changing the exposure level within each subgroup, and discuss its relevance to the research question.\n\n4.  **Comparison of Subgroups:** Discuss how differences in causal effect estimates between different subgroups, if observed, or if not observed, contribute to the overall findings of the study.\n\n5.  **Uncertainty and Confidence Intervals:** Consider the uncertainty around the estimated causal effects, and interpret the confidence intervals to understand the precision of the estimates.\n\n6.  **Generalisability and Transportability:** Reflect on the generalizability of the study results to other contexts or populations. Discuss any factors that might influence the transportability of the causal effects found in the study. (Again see lecture 9.)\n\n7.  **Assumptions and Limitations:** Reflect on the assumptions made during the study and identify any limitations in the methodology that could affect the interpretation of results. State that the implications of different intervention levels on potential outcomes are not analysed.\n\n8.  **Theoretical Relevance**: How are these findings relevant to existing theories.\n\n9.  **Replication and Future Research:** Consider how the study could be replicated or expanded upon in future research, and how the findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the field.\n\n10. **Real-world Implications:** Discuss the real-world implications of the findings, and how they could be applied in policy, practice, or further research.\n\n## Example anlaysis (week 10)\n\n## Load Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# Before running this source code, make sure to update to the current version of R, and to update all existing packages.\n\n# functions\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-bayes/templates/main/functions/funs.R\")\n\n\n# experimental functions (more functions)\nsource(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-bayes/templates/main/functions/experimental_funs.R\"\n)\n\n\n#  If you haven't already, you should have created a folder called \"data\", in your Rstudio project.

some more data wrangling, alas! Data wrangling is the majority of data analysis. The good news is that R makes wrangling relatively straightforward.\n\n1.  `mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare)))`: This creates a new column called `id` that has unique identification factors for each row in the dataset. It ranges from 1 to the number of rows in the dataset.\n\n2.  The next `mutate` operation is used to convert the `t0_eth_cat`, `t0_urban`, and `t0_gen_cohort` variables to factor type, if they are not already.\n\n3.  The `filter` command is used to subset the dataset to only include rows where the `t0_eth_cat` is either \"euro\" or \"māori\". The original dataset includes data with four different ethnic categories. This command filters out any row not related to these two groups.\n\n4.  `ungroup()` ensures that there is no grouping in the dataframe.\n\n5.  The `mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\"))` step standardizes all numeric columns in the dataset by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (a z-score transformation). The resulting columns are renamed to include \"\\_z\" at the end of their original names.\n\n6.  The `select` function is used to keep only specific columns: the `id` column, any columns that are factors, and any columns that end in \"\\_z\".\n\n7.  The `relocate` functions re-order columns. The first `relocate` places the `id` column at the beginning. The next three `relocate` functions order the rest of the columns based on their names: those starting with \"t0\\_\" are placed before \"t1\\_\" columns, and those starting with \"t2\\_\" are placed after \"t1\\_\" columns.\n\n8.  `droplevels()` removes unused factor levels in the dataframe.\n\n9.  Finally, `skimr::skim(dt)` will print out a summary of the data in the `dt` object using the skimr package. This provides a useful overview of the data, including data types and summary statistics.\n\nThis function seems to be part of a data preparation pipeline in a longitudinal or panel analysis, where observations are ordered over time (indicated by t0\\_, t1\\_, t2\\_, etc.).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### ### ### ### ### ### SUBGROUP DATA ANALYSIS: DATA WRANGLING  ### ### ### ###\n\ndt <- dt_prepare|>\n  mutate(id = factor(1:nrow(dt_prepare))) |>\n  mutate(\n  t0_eth_cat = as.factor(t0_eth_cat),\n  t0_urban = as.factor(t0_urban),\n  t0_gen_cohort = as.factor(t0_gen_cohort)\n) |>\n  dplyr::filter(t0_eth_cat == \"euro\" |\n                t0_eth_cat == \"māori\") |> # Too few asian and pacific\n  ungroup() |>\n  # transform numeric variables into z scores (improves estimation)\n  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.x), .names = \"{col}_z\")) %>%\n  # select only factors and numeric values that are z-scores\n  select(id, # category is too sparse\n         where(is.factor),\n         ends_with(\"_z\"), ) |>\n  # tidy data frame so that the columns are ordered by time (useful for more complex models)\n  relocate(id, .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))   |>\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t0_\"), .before = starts_with(\"t1_\"))  |>\n  relocate(starts_with(\"t2_\"), .after = starts_with(\"t1_\")) |>\n  droplevels()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# checks\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_depression_z)\nhist(dt$t2_kessler_latent_anxiety_z)\nhist(dt$t1_hour_exercise_log_z)\n\ndt |>\n  tabyl(t0_eth_cat, t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ) |>\n  kbl(format = \"markdown\")\n\n# Visualise missingness\nnaniar::vis_miss(dt)\n\n# save your dataframe for future use\n\n# make dataframe\ndt = as.data.frame(dt)\n\n# save data\nsaveRDS(dt, here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Calculate propensity scores\n\nNext we generate propensity scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read  data -- you may start here if you need to repeat the analysis\ndt <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n# get column names\nbaseline_vars_reflective_propensity <- dt|>\n  dplyr::select(starts_with(\"t0\"), -t0_eth_cat, -t0_hours_exercise_log_z) |> colnames()\n\n# define our exposure\nX <- \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen\"\n\n# define subclasses\nS <- \"t0_eth_cat\"\n\n# Make sure data is in a data frame format\ndt <- data.frame(dt)\n\n\n# next we use our trick for creating a formula string, which will reduce our work\nformula_str_prop <-\n  paste(X,\n        \"~\",\n        paste(baseline_vars_reflective_propensity, collapse = \"+\"))\n\n# this shows the exposure variable as predicted by the baseline confounders.\nformula_str_prop\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"t1_hours_exercise_coarsen ~ t0_male+t0_gen_cohort+t0_urban+t0_hours_exercise_coarsen+t0_edu_z+t0_employed_z+t0_nz_dep2018_z+t0_nzsei13_z+t0_partner_z+t0_parent_z+t0_pol_orient_z+t0_agreeableness_z+t0_conscientiousness_z+t0_extraversion_z+t0_honesty_humility_z+t0_openness_z+t0_neuroticism_z+t0_modesty_z+t0_religion_identification_level_z+t0_kessler_latent_anxiety_z+t0_kessler_latent_depression_z\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor propensity score analysis, we will try several different approaches.

Of these approaches, entropy balancing provided the best balance. The results indicate an excellent balance across all variables, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold of 0.05 across a range of binary and continuous baseline confounders, including gender, generation cohort, urban_location, exercise hours (coarsened, baseline), education, employment status, depression, anxiety, and various personality traits. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs.\n\n> The effective sample sizes were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 2880, 3927, and 1834, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 1855.89, 3659.59, and 1052.01, respectively.\n\n> The weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2310 to 7.0511) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.5769 to 1.9603). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n> We also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n> We plotted these results using love plots, visually confirming both the balance in the propensity score model using entropy balanced weights, and the imbalance in the model that does not adjust for baseline confounders.\n\n> Overall, these findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, conditional on the measured covariates included in the model.\n\n### Example Summary Maori Propensity scores.\n\nResults:\n\n> The entropy balancing method was also the best performing method that was applied to a subgroup analysis of the Māori population. Similar to the NZ European subgroup analysis, the method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup. The Max.Diff.Adj values for all variables were well below the target threshold of 0.05, with most variables achieving a Max.Diff.Adj of 0.0001 or lower. This indicates a high level of balance across all treatment pairs for the Māori subgroup.\n\n> The effective sample sizes for the Māori subgroup were also adjusted using entropy balancing. The unadjusted sample sizes for the inactive, active, and very active groups were 307, 354, and 160, respectively. After adjustment, the effective sample sizes were reduced to 220.54, 321.09, and 76.39, respectively\n\n> The weight ranges for the inactive, active, and very active groups in the Māori subgroup varied, with the inactive group showing the widest range (0.2213 to 3.8101) and the active group showing the narrowest range (0.3995 to 1.9800). Despite these variations, the coefficient of variation, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and entropy were all within acceptable limits for each group, indicating a good balance of weights.\n\n> The study also identified the units with the five most extreme weights by group for the Māori subgroup. These units exhibited higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups, but they did not significantly affect the overall balance of weights.\n\n> In conclusion, the results of the Māori subgroup analysis are consistent with the overall analysis. The entropy balancing method achieved a high level of balance across all treatment pairs, with Max.Diff.Adj values significantly below the target threshold. These findings support the use of entropy balancing in propensity score analysis to ensure a balanced distribution of covariates across treatment groups, even in subgroup analyses.\n\n### More data wrangling, again, this time for the weights on the continuous exposure\n\nNote that we need to attach the `weights` from the propensity score model back to the data.\n\nHowever, because our weighting analysis estimates a model for the *exposure*, we only need to do this analysis once, no matter how many outcomes we investigate. So there ia a little good news.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# prepare nz_euro data\ndt<- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\")) # original data subset only nz europeans\n\ndt_ref_e <- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"euro\") # original data subset only nz europeans\n\n\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_e$weights <- dt_match_ebal$euro$weights # get weights from the ps matching model,add to data\n\n# prepare maori data\ndt_ref_m <- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"māori\")# original data subset only maori\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_m$weights <- dt_match_ebal$māori$weights # get weights from the ps matching model, add to data\n\n# combine data into one data frame\ndt_ref_all <- rbind(dt_ref_e, dt_ref_m) # combine the data into one dataframe. \n\n# save data for later use, if needed\nsaveRDS(dt_ref_all, here::here(\"data\",\"dt_ref_all\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Anxiety Analysis and Results\n\nBelow shows the new code for our regression analysis. Notably, we have adjusted the regression model to include a spline, which allows for a non-linear relationship between the continuous exposure and the outcome. By accommodating potential non-linear effects, we improve the robustness of our model, reducing the risk of misspecification.

Hence, while the estimates suggest a potential effect of Exercise on Depression for the Māori Depression, the substantial uncertainty and possible influence of unmeasured confounders mean these findings should be interpreted with caution.\"      \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Estimate the subgroup contrast\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# calculated above\nest_all_d <- readRDS( here::here(\"data\",\"est_all_d\"))\n\n# make the sumamry into a dataframe so we can make a table\ndfd <- as.data.frame(summary(est_all_d))\n\n# get rownames for selecting the correct row\ndfd$RowName <- row.names(dfd)\n\n# select the correct row -- the group contrast\nfiltered_dfd <- dfd |> \n  dplyr::filter(RowName == \"RD_m - RD_e\") \n\n\n# Print the filtered data frame\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nfiltered_dfd  |> \n  select(-RowName) |> \n  kbl(digits = 3) |> \n  kable_material(c(\"striped\", \"hover\")) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\" lightable-material lightable-striped lightable-hover\" style='font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\", helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Estimate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2.5 % </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 97.5 % </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> RD_m - RD_e </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.068 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -0.09 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.229 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nReporting might be: \n\n> The estimated reduction of depression from exercise is higher overall for New Zealand Europeans (RD_e) compared to Māori (RD_m). This is suggested by the estimated risk difference (RD_m - RD_e) of 0.068. However, there is a degree of uncertainty in this estimate, as the confidence interval (-0.09 to 0.229) crosses zero. This suggests that we cannot be confident that the difference in depression reduction between New Zealand Europeans and Māori is statistically significant. It's possible that the true difference could be zero or even negative, implying a greater depression reduction for Māori than New Zealand Europeans. Thus, while the results hint at a larger depression reduction for New Zealand Europeans, the uncertainty in this estimate urges us to interpret this difference with caution.\n\n\n\n### Discusion \n\nYou'll need to write the discussion for yourself. Here's a start: \n\n\n> In our study, we employed a robust statistical method that helps us estimate the impact of exercise on reducing anxiety among different population groups – New Zealand Europeans and Māori. This method has the advantage of providing reliable results even if our underlying assumptions aren't entirely accurate – a likely scenario given the complexity of real-world data.  However, this robustness comes with a trade-off: it gives us wider ranges of uncertainty in our estimates. This doesn't mean the analysis is flawed; rather, it accurately represents our level of certainty given the data we have.\n\n#### **Exercise and anxiety**\n\n> Our analysis suggests that exercise may have a greater effect in reducing anxiety among New Zealand Europeans compared to Māori. This conclusion comes from our primary causal estimate, the risk difference, which is 0.104. However, it's crucial to consider our uncertainty in this value. We represent this uncertainty as a range, also known as a confidence interval. In this case, the interval ranges from -0.042 to 0.279. What this means is, given our current data and method, the true effect could plausibly be anywhere within this range. While our best estimate shows a higher reduction in anxiety for New Zealand Europeans, the range of plausible values includes zero and even negative values. This implies that the true effect could be no difference between the two groups or even a higher reduction in Māori. Hence, while there is an indication of a difference, we should interpret it cautiously given the wide range of uncertainty.\n\n> Thus, although our analysis points towards a potential difference in how exercise reduces anxiety among these groups, the level of uncertainty means we should be careful about drawing firm conclusions. More research is needed to further explore these patterns.\n\n#### **Exercise and depression**\n\n\n> In addition to anxiety, we also examined the effect of exercise on depression. We do not find evidence for reduction of depression from exercise in either group. We do not find evidence for the effect of weekly exercise -- as self-reported -- on depression. \n\n#### **Limitations**\n\n> It is important to bear in mind that statistical results are only one piece of a larger scientific puzzle about the relationship between excercise and well-being. Other pieces include understanding the context, incorporating subject matter knowledge, and considering the implications of the findings. In the present study, wide confidence intervals suggest the possibility of considerable individual differences.$\\dots$ nevertheless, $\\dots$\n\n\n**Again, you will need to come up with your own discussion, but you may follow the step-by-step instructions above as a guide.**\n\n\n## Appendix: Continuous Exposure\n\n\n### Check positivity in continuous variable \n\nNote we are using the natural log of exercise because the variable is highly dispersed.  Any linear transformation of a continuous variable will be OK as far as regression is concerned.  \n\nLet's see how much change there is in the rounded log value of exercise. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# \n\nout_m_cont  <- msm::statetable.msm(hours_exercise_log_round, id, data = dt_exposure_maori)\n\n# with this little support we might consider parametric models\nt_tab_m_c<- transition_table( out_m_cont)\n\n#interpretation\ncat(t_tab_m_c$explanation)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nThis transition matrix describes the shifts from one state to another between the baseline wave and the following wave. The numbers in the cells represent the number of individuals who transitioned from one state (rows) to another (columns). For example, the cell in the first row and second column shows the number of individuals who transitioned from the first state (indicated by the left-most cell in the row) to the second state. The top left cell shows the number of individuals who remained in the first state.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(t_tab_m_c$table)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\n|  From   | State 0 | State 1 | State 2 | State 3 | State 4 | State 5 |\n|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|\n| State 0 |   31    |   35    |   29    |    2    |    1    |    0    |\n| State 1 |   31    |   134   |   97    |   11    |    1    |    1    |\n| State 2 |   14    |   87    |   240   |   27    |    0    |    1    |\n| State 3 |    1    |   10    |   29    |   18    |    5    |    0    |\n| State 4 |    1    |    5    |    1    |    3    |    6    |    0    |\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# there is not much change in the extremes.

In this scenario, the regression model leaves `weights` or simply unspecified. \n\nHowever, the 'energy' balancing method provided by the `weightit` package offers robust results when estimating propensity scores for continuous exposures. Given this favorable characteristic, we will utilize energy balancing to estimate propensity scores for our continuous exercise exposure variable.\n\n### Continuous model propensity scores\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read  data -- you may start here if you need to repeat the analysis\ndt <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\"))\n\n# get column names\nbaseline_vars_reflective_propensity_c <- dt|>\n  dplyr::select(starts_with(\"t0\"), -t0_eth_cat, -t0_hours_exercise_coarsen) |> colnames() # note we remove the coarsened excercise variable at baseline.\n\n# define our exposure\nX_c <- \"t1_hours_exercise_log_z\"\n# define subclasses\nS <- \"t0_eth_cat\"\n\n# Make sure data is in a data frame format\ndt <- data.frame(dt)\n\n\n# next we use our trick for creating a formula string, which will reduce our work\nformula_str_prop_c <-\n  paste(X_c,\n        \"~\",\n        paste(baseline_vars_reflective_propensity_c, collapse = \"+\"))\n\n# this shows the exposure variable as predicted by the baseline confounders.\nformula_str_prop_c\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"t1_hours_exercise_log_z ~ t0_male+t0_gen_cohort+t0_urban+t0_edu_z+t0_employed_z+t0_nz_dep2018_z+t0_nzsei13_z+t0_partner_z+t0_parent_z+t0_pol_orient_z+t0_agreeableness_z+t0_conscientiousness_z+t0_extraversion_z+t0_honesty_humility_z+t0_openness_z+t0_neuroticism_z+t0_modesty_z+t0_religion_identification_level_z+t0_hours_exercise_log_z+t0_kessler_latent_anxiety_z+t0_kessler_latent_depression_z\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nAgain, we will only use the `energy` method, see <https://ngreifer.github.io/WeightIt/>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## energy balance method\n# Distance Covariance Optimal Weighting (\"energy\")\n\ndt = as.data.frame(dt)\nformula_str_prop_c\n\n\n# this is not working\ndt_match_energy_c <- match_mi_general(\n  data = dt,\n  X = X_c,\n  baseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity_c,\n  subgroup = \"t0_eth_cat\",\n  estimand = \"ATE\",\n  #focal = \"high\", # for use with ATT\n  method = \"energy\"\n)\n\nsaveRDS(dt_match_energy_c, here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy_c\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nPropensity score assessment on a continuous exposure; let's examine NZ Europeans\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#dt_match_energy <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy\"))\ndt_match_energy_c <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_energy_c\"))\n#dt_match_ps <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt_match_ps\"))\n\n# next we inspect balance. \"Max.Diff.Adj\" should ideally be less than .05, but less than .1 is ok.

We then estimated propensity scores within the NZ European subgroup for this continuous exposure `t1_hours_exercise_log_z` using energy balancing in the `WeightIt` package in R.\n\n>The balance measures table reports Corr.Adj values for a range of binary and continuous variables, serving as a measure of balance achieved post-propensity score adjustment. Corr.Adj values that are close to zero suggest that these variables are balanced across the exposure groups after weighting. For example, the Corr.Adj values for variables such as `t0_urban_urban` (a binary variable) and `t0_edu_z` (a continuous variable) were -0.0015 and -0.0001, respectively, indicating excellent balance. The variable representing the log-transformed hours of exercise, `t0_hours_exercise_log_z`, exhibited a Corr.Adj of 0.0104, which is still significantly below our target threshold of 0.05, suggesting an acceptable level of balance.\n\n> The initial total unadjusted sample size was 8641. After energy balancing adjustment, the effective sample size was reduced to 5200.62. The reduction in sample size comes from the application of weights to the observations, thereby reducing imbalance across the exposure groups. \n\n> The range of weights, as reported in the summary of weights, varied from 0 to 2.8893. Despite this relatively wide range, the weight statistics show that the balance of weights is acceptable. The coefficient of variation was 0.518, the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) was 0.407, and entropy was 0.15, all indicating a reasonable balance of weights across the samples. \n\n> In addition, we identified the five units with the most extreme weights. These units had higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups. However, the balance of weights was not significantly affected by these extreme cases.\n\n>The unweighted and weighted effective sample sizes were also reported. The total unweighted sample size was 821, while the weighted sample size, after the application of energy balancing, was 647.62.\n\n> We infer that the application of energy balancing to estimate propensity scores for the continuous exposure variable `t1_hours_exercise_log_z` resulted in a good level of balance across all covariates in our sample. These results support the use of energy balancing in propensity score analysis when handling continuous exposure variables, effectively reducing bias and creating a more balanced distribution of covariates across exposure groups.\n\n### Example Summary Maori Propensity scores.\n\n> We also estimated propensity scores for the continuous exposure `t1_hours_exercise_log_z` within the Maori subgroup using energy balancing in the `WeightIt` package in R. The analysis output provides a detailed view of the balance achieved and is summarized as follows:\n\n> The balance measures table provides Corr.Adj values for a range of binary and continuous variables. These Corr.Adj values indicate the level of balance achieved post-propensity score adjustment. A Corr.Adj value closer to zero signifies an excellent balance across the exposure groups post weighting. For instance, the `t0_urban_urban` (a binary variable) showed a Corr.Adj value of -0.0066 and `t0_edu_z` (a continuous variable) exhibited a Corr.Adj value of 0.0116, both indicating a fair balance. However, the log-transformed hours of exercise, `t0_hours_exercise_log_z`, had a Corr.Adj of 0.0515, just surpassing our target threshold of 0.05. This suggests a slightly reduced level of balance for this particular variable compared to others.\n\n> The total unadjusted sample size was 821, and after energy balancing adjustment, the effective sample size was reduced to 647.62. The reduction in sample size is attributed to the application of weights to the observations, aiming to minimize imbalance across the exposure groups.\n\n> The range of weights, as reported in the summary of weights, varied from 0 to 2.8893. Despite the relatively wide range, the weight statistics demonstrate that the balance of weights is acceptable. The coefficient of variation was 0.518, the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) was 0.407, and entropy was 0.15, all indicating an acceptable balance of weights across the samples.\n\n> We also identified the five units with the most extreme weights. These units possessed higher weights compared to the rest of the units in their respective groups. However, these extreme weights did not significantly disrupt the overall balance.\n\n> The total unweighted sample size was 821, while the weighted sample size, after the application of energy balancing, was 647.62.\n\n> We infer that energy balancing procedure applied to estimate propensity scores for the continuous exposure variable `t1_hours_exercise_log_z` within the Maori subgroup resulted in an acceptable level of balance across most covariates. The energy balancing approach effectively reduces bias and ensured a balanced distribution of covariates across exposure groups, reaffirming its utility in propensity score analysis for continuous exposure variables. However, for the variable `t0_hours_exercise_log_z`, some attention may be needed due to a Corr.Adj value slightly exceeding the usual threshold.\n\n### More data wrangling\n\nNote that we need to attach the `weights` from the propensity score model back to the data.\n\nHowever, because our weighting analysis estimates a model for the *exposure*, we only need to do this analysis once, no matter how many outcomes we investigate. So, again, there is a little good news.(I will leave the depression outcome analysis to you.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# prepare nz_euro data\ndt<- readRDS(here::here(\"data\", \"dt\")) # original data subset only nz europeans\ndt_ref_e_c <- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"euro\") # original data subset only nz europeans\n\n\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_e_c$weights <- dt_match_energy_c$euro$weights # get weights from the ps matching model,add to data\n\n# prepare maori data\ndt_ref_m_c <- subset(dt, t0_eth_cat == \"māori\")# original data subset only maori\n\n# add weights\ndt_ref_m_c$weights <- dt_match_energy_c$māori$weights # get weights from the ps matching model, add to data\n\n# combine data into one data frame\ndt_ref_all_c <- rbind(dt_ref_e_c, dt_ref_m_c) # combine the data into one dataframe. \n\n# save data for later use, if needed\nsaveRDS(dt_ref_all_c, here::here(\"data\",\"dt_ref_all_c\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Anxiety Analysis and Results: Continuous Exposure\n\nThis is the analysis code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# we do not evaluate to save time\n### SUBGROUP analysis\ndf <-  dt_ref_all_c\nY <-  \"t2_kessler_latent_anxiety_z\"\nX_c <- t1_hours_exercise_log_z# already defined above\nbaseline_vars = baseline_vars_reflective_propensity_c\ntreat_0 = 0\ntreat_1 = 1\nestimand = \"ATE\"\nscale = \"RD\"\nnsims = 1000\nfamily = \"gaussian\"\ncontinuous_X = TRUE # note change\nsplines = TRUE # note change\ncores = parallel::detectCores()\nS = \"t0_eth_cat\"\n\n# not we interact the subclass X treatment X covariates\n\nformula_str_c <-\n  paste(\n    Y,\n    \"~\",\n    S,\n    \"*\",\n    \"(\",\n    X_c ,\n    \"*\",\n    \"(\",\n    paste(baseline_vars_reflective_propensity_c, collapse = \"+\"),\n    \")\",\n    \")\"\n  )\n\n# formula_str. # inspect on our own time \n\n\n\n# fit model\nfit_all_all_c  <- glm(\n  as.formula(formula_str_c),\n  weights = weights,\n  # weights = if (!is.null(weight_var)) weight_var else NULL,\n  family = family,\n  data = df\n)\n\n# simulate coefficients\nconflicts_prefer(clarify::sim)\nsim_model_all_c <- sim(fit_all_all_c, n = nsims, vcov = \"HC0\")\n\n# simulate effect as modified in europeans\nsim_estimand_all_e_c <- sim_ame(\n  sim_model_all_c,\n  var = X_c,\n  cl = cores,\n  subset = t0_eth_cat == \"euro\",\n  verbose = TRUE\n)\n\ntab_e_c<- summary(sim_estimand_all_e_c)\n\ntab_real_euro <- tab_ate(tab_e_c, delta = 1, sd = 1, type =\"RD\", continuous_X = TRUE, new_name = \"NZ Euro Anxiety, Continuous X\")\n\n# tab_real_euro\n\n\n\n# simulate effect as modified in europeans\nsim_estimand_all_m_c <- sim_ame(\n  sim_model_all_c,\n  var = X_c,\n  cl = cores,\n  subset = t0_eth_cat == \"māori\",\n  verbose = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\ntab_m_c<- summary(sim_estimand_all_m_c)\n\ntab_real_maori<- tab_ate(tab_m_c, delta = 1, sd = 1, type =\"RD\", continuous_X = TRUE, new_name = \"Māori Anxiety Anxiety, Continuous X\")\n\n#tab_real_maori\n\n# Save tables \nsaveRDS(tab_real_euro, here::here(\"data\",\"tab_real_euro\"))\n\nsaveRDS(tab_real_maori, here::here(\"data\",\"tab_real_maori\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Table of Subgroup Results plus Evalues\n\n\nI've created functions for reporting results so you can use this code, changing it to suit your analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# return stored estimates \ntab_real_euro <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\",\"tab_real_euro\"))\ntab_real_maori <- readRDS(here::here(\"data\",\"tab_real_maori\"))\n\nbig_tab_c <- rbind(tab_real_euro,tab_real_maori)\n\n# expand tables \nplot_ed_c <- sub_group_tab(tab_real_euro, type= \"RD\")\nplot_md_c <- sub_group_tab(tab_real_maori, type= \"RD\")\n\n# use this for graph\nbig_tab_d_c <- rbind(plot_ed_c,plot_md_c)\n\n# use this simple table for the report\nbig_tab_c |> \n  kbl(format=\"markdown\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|                                    | E[Y(1)]-E[Y(0)]|   2.5 %|  97.5 %| E_Value| E_Val_bound|\n|:-----------------------------------|---------------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-----------:|\n|NZ Euro Anxiety, Continuous X       |         -0.0292| -0.0527| -0.0064|   1.193|        1.08|\n|Māori Anxiety Anxiety, Continuous X |         -0.0066| -0.0717|  0.0616|   1.084|        1.00|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Graph of the result\n\nI've create a function you can use to graph your results.

The causal contrast, in this case, compares the effect of exercising 13.12 hours per week (the treatment group) to exercising 5.88 hours per week (the control group). \n\n> For the New Zealand European group, the causal contrast value decreased from -0.077 in the first output to -0.029 in the second output. This suggests a smaller estimated effect of exercise on reducing anxiety when considering continuous exposure compared to the initial analysis. The associated confidence interval (-0.053 to -0.006) in the second output does not cross zero, suggesting more certainty in the negative effect of exercise on anxiety compared to the initial results. However, the E-values, reflecting the potential impact of unmeasured confounding variables, suggest that the interpretation of these findings should be made with caution. \n\n> For the Māori group, the second analysis indicates a reduced effect of exercise on anxiety compared to the first analysis, with the causal contrast decreasing from 0.027 to -0.007. However, the associated confidence interval for this estimate (-0.072 to 0.062) crosses zero, echoing the initial results and indicating considerable uncertainties in the estimate. The E-values further reinforce that these findings should be interpreted with caution due to potential unmeasured confounding factors. \n\n> Thus, while both the categorical and continuous exposure results suggest a potential influence of exercise in reducing anxiety for NZ Europeans, although perhaps not Māori, the effects seem to be less pronounced in NZ Europeans when modelling a continuous exercise exposure. \n> However, it is important to note that each model addresses a different causal question. The categorical exposure model investigates the contrast between not exercising at all and exercising over eight hours per week. On the other hand, the continuous exposure model examines the contrast between exercising almost six hours a week and doubling that amount of exercise.\n\n> These two modelling approaches describe different hypothetical experiments. Arguably, neither scenario reflects realistic interventions. Nonetheless, the indication of exercise potentially aiding in anxiety reduction in NZ Europeans tentatively suggests it might be worthwhile to further investigate the role of exercise in promoting mental health, and also for identifying pathways to better expressing exercise benefits on mental health among Māori\n\n\nI'll pass the baton back to you now to refine the interpretation of these results.
