Understand the special problems that cultural research presents for **measurement.**\n2.  Understand the deeper, and prior concept of **confounding.**\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  Measurement\n2.  Validity \n3.  A confounder \n\n\n## Where does psychology start?\n\nPsychology starts with a question about how people think or behave.\n\n## Examples of psychological questions?\n\n-   How does early childhood experience affect personality and behaviour?\n\n-   What are the effects of social media on self-esteem?\n\n-   Why do some people believe in a God or gods and others do not?\n\n-   Why are some people motivated to sacrifice for others?\n\n-   Does marriage make people happy?\n\n## Example of psychological questions in cross-cultural psychology\n\n-   How do early childhood experiences differ across cultures, and how do these differences impact personality and behavior development?\n\n-   Are there cultural differences in the way social media use affects self-esteem and body image?\n\n-   How do cultural and religious beliefs shape individual attitudes towards the concept of God or gods?\n\n-   What are the cultural and individual factors that motivate people to engage in acts of altruism or sacrifice for others, and how do these factors vary across cultures?\n\n-   Are there cultural differences in the factors that contribute to marital satisfaction and happiness, and how do cultural expectations and values surrounding marriage play a role?\n\n## How might psychological scientists answer whether marriage makes people happy?\n\n## *Wrong* answers only\n\n-   \"Ask my married parents if they are happy.\"\n\n-   \"Consult a palm reader.\"\n\n-   Assert: \"Yes marriage always makes people happy\"; \"No marriage can't possibly make anyone happy\"\n\n-   Intuit: \"It depends on the gender of the individual. Men are always happier in marriage, while women are never happier.\"\n\n-   Intuition: \"It depends on the cultural background of the individuals. Couples from Western cultures are always happier in marriage, while couples from Eastern cultures are never happier.\"\n\n-   Conduct a literature review of previous research on the association between marriage and happiness, including cross-cultural studies that compare different cultural attitudes and practices regarding marriage and their relationship to happiness.\n\n-   Conduct a survey of a large and diverse sample of individuals to assess their happiness levels, as well as their marital status assess the relationship.\n\n## Conduct a literature review of previous research {.incremental}\n\n-   What would this tell us?\n\n    -   what other researchers have found.\n\n-   What would this not tell us?\n\n    -   what other researchers have not found.\n    -   what other researchers got wrong.\n\n## Conduct a survey of a large and diverse sample of individuals\n\n-   Where to begin?\n\n## Measurement\n\nDefinitions:\n\n-   \"Measurement is the numerical quantifcation of the attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events\" \\[Conventional\\]\n-   \"Measurement is the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to rules.\" \\[Psychological\\]\n-   \"Measurement is the process of experimentally obtaining one or more quantity values that can reasonably be attributed to a quantity.\" \\[Metrological\\] from [@briggs2021]\n\n## \"On a scale of 1-7, how happy are you?\"\n\nHow might this go wrong?\n\n-   Ambiguity: Respondents may interpret \"happiness\" in different ways. -e.g. Some people may equate happiness with a momentary positive emotion -e.g. Others may think of happiness as a long-term state of contentment.\n-   Social Desirability Bias: Respondents may want to tell you what they think you want to hear. Others might want to frustrate you.\n-   Mood: the context in which the question is asked and the respondent's current mood might affect the answer (reliability)\n-   Limited range of scale\n-   What do the endpoints mean?\n-   Cultural Differences:\n    -   in meanings\n    -   in constructs themselves\n    \n## In survey research\n\nConstruct: e.g. Happiness - a subjective experience of positive emotions, such as joy, contentment, and satisfaction with life/\n\nItem: A question or statement used to measure an aspect of happiness. Example: \"I feel content with my life.\"\n\nScale: A collection of items designed to measure a construct. Example: a happiness scale might consist of items rated on a Likert-type scale, with an overall score reflecting the level of happiness being measured. Example: \n\n- \"In general, how happy do you feel?\" (rated on a scale from 1 - not at all happy to 5 - extremely happy)\n- \"How often do you feel positive emotions, such as joy or contentment?\" (rated on a scale from 1 - very rarely or never to 5 - very often or always)\n- \"How satisfied are you with your life as a whole?\" (rated on a scale from 1 - very dissatisfied to 5 - very satisfied)\n    \n\n## Concept of validity in psychometric research\n\n-   Content Validity: The degree an instrument measures what it is intended to measure (the \"construct\").\n-   Construct Validity: Whether the construct assumed to measure is accurately defined and operationalised.\n-   Criterion Validity: Whether an instrument accurately predicts performance.\n-   Face Validity: whether an instrument measure what it is intended to measure, as assessed by experts.\n-   Ecological Validity: whether an instrument accurately reflects real-world situations and behavior [@bandalos2018]\n\n## What can we do about it?\n\n-Week 10: \n\n:::{.notes}\nMetric equivalence: Factor loadings are similar across groups.\nConfigural equivalence: The factor structure is the same across groups in a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis.\nScalar equivalence: Values/Means are also equivalent across groups.\n:::\n\n## What else might go wrong?\n\nSuppose we are confident in measurement, administer survey, and find an relationship.\n\n::: {.fragment .highlight-red}\nDoes marriage cause happiness cross culturally?\n:::\n\n\n## What might go wrong?\n\n\n## Happiness might *cause* marriage\n\n\n\n## Age might cause both Marriage and Happiness\n\n- That is Age might be a *confounder by common cause*\n\n\n## Many psychologists will simply \"control for age\"\n\n::: {.fragment .highlight-red}\nThis doesn't work if there is reverse causation: \nRegression coefficient for Marriage (M) is biased.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Simulate data \nset.seed(123)\nsim_fun_B = function() {\n  n <- 1000\n  A <- rnorm(n, 1) # simulates age,\n  H <- rnorm(n , A) #  simulates happy as function of age\n  M <- rnorm(n , A) + .2 * H # simulate marriage as a function of age + happiness\n\n  \n# Simulate dataframe from function\nsimdat_B <- data.frame(\n  A = A, \n  H = H,\n  M = M) \n\n#  model in which marriage \"predicts\" happiness controlling for age\nsim_B <- lm(H ~ M + A, data = simdat_B)\nsim_B  # returns output\n}\n\n# Replication 100 times\nr_lm_B <- NA\nr_lm_B = replicate(100, sim_fun_B(), simplify = FALSE )\n\n# print model results\nparameters::pool_parameters(r_lm_B)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# Fixed Effects\n\nParameter   | Coefficient |   SE |        95% CI | Statistic |     df |      p\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |    4.12e-03 | 0.06 | [-0.12, 0.13] |      0.07 | 220.99 | 0.947 \nM           |        0.19 | 0.04 | [ 0.10, 0.27] |      4.42 | 234.19 | < .001\nA           |        0.77 | 0.07 | [ 0.64, 0.91] |     11.17 | 211.13 | < .001\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The problem is confounding: what can we do about it?\n\n- Weeks 2-4: Causal Diagrams\n\n## What have we learned? \n\n**Key Concepts**\n::: {.fragment .highlight-red}\n1.
