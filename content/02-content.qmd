## Overview

This session is devoted to learning R. There are no required readings. 

  
## Slides

Torven's slides will be on Nuku/Canvas.



## OPTIONAL extra material

Proofread version:

(1) A helpful resource for learning R is Megan Hall's lecture available at: [https://meghan.rbind.io/talk/neair/](https://meghan.rbind.io/talk/neair/).

(2) RStudio has compiled numerous accessible materials for learning R, which can be found here: [https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/).

(3) Materials from a previous course on learning R can be accessed here.  [https://go-bayes.github.io/psych-447/](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) For now, only lecture 1 would be relevant. It's worth noting that this lecture covers working with GitHub. While GitHub is a useful tool, it's not a requirement for the current course.
