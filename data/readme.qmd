This is a synthetic data file. The data are simulated from the a sub sample of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).

The code to create the synthetic data set, before noise was added to the variables is given below.

## Where can I go for further information?

The NZAVS website is maintained by Prof Chris Sibley. Here is a [Link](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study.html)
