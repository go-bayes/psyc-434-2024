    "text": "Course Description\nThe official description:\nThis course will focus on theoretical and practical challenges for conducting research involving individuals from more than one cultural background or ethnicity. Topics are likely to include defining and measuring culture; developing culture-sensitive studies, choice of language and translation; communication styles and bias; questionnaire and interview design; qualitative and quantitative data analysis for cultural and cross-cultural research; minorities, power and ethics in cross-cultural research; and ethno-methodologies and indigenous research methodologies. Appropriate background for this course: PSYC 338."

    "text": "Course Learning Objectives\nPreamble: in this advanced course, students will develop foundational skills in cross-cultural psychological research with a strong emphasis on causal inference, a new and critical methodological approach.\n\nProgramming in R students will learn the basics of programming in the statistical language R, gaining essential computational tools for psychological research. This will lay the foundation for applying data analysis techniques in a causal inference framework, and beyond.\nUnderstanding Causal Inference. students will develop a robust understanding of causal inference concepts and approaches, with particular emphasis on how they mitigate common pitfalls in cross-cultural research. We will focus on how to design studies, analyze data, and draw strong conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships across cultures.\nUnderstanding Measurement in Comparative Settings. students will learn techniques for constructing and validating psychometrically sound measures across diverse cultures. We will examine how to ensure measurements are reliable, cross-culturally valid, and aligned with theoretical constructs, while keeping a strong focus on causal reasoning."
